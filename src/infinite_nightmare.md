### ðŸ”ž warning! some of this stuff will be nsfw or include art that is nsfw ðŸ”ž
thats just art baby! people are naked a _lot_ as it turns out

welcome to the infinite nightmare list aka a big dumpster for me to put art related stuff that i want to revisit at some point. each section should have a reason that i want to revisit a link. also, i will probably just take images directly from the source so if shit is broken then that would be why

**i can't find a source for this one**

also nishio nanoro does heaps of cool mechs and medieval armour but they do feel a _little_ out of my skill level

these reference sheets are super useful for inspiration and study from a particular artist as it gives a bunch of ideas all at once and also lets you compare the same art style from different angles and poses

murninator does these lovely hands that i really want to emulate, as well as good anatomy and simplification techniques for anthro characters. some excellent poses too a la

these sketches are honestly insane theres some really nice realistic anatomy merged with pretty simplified faces and a fun variety of costume and expressions. a lot of these characters also have curly hair which is something i'm trying to work on at the moment

i'm really into the simplification methods and the curvy style of all the clothing in this pic - almost no straight lines. the artist also does heaps with floating / falling poses which is something i want to use more in the future

mauler draws these incredibly solid and chunky looking bone and muscles masses. very bridgman esque. theres also a lot of progress photos which are super nice for learning
