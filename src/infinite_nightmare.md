### ðŸ”ž warning! some of this stuff will be nsfw or include art that is nsfw ðŸ”ž
thats just art baby! people are naked a _lot_ as it turns out

welcome to the infinite nightmare list aka a big dumpster for me to put art related stuff that i want to revisit at some point. each section should have a reason that i want to revisit a link. also, i will probably just take images directly from the source so if shit is broken then that would be why

seeing this artist on my timeline gave me immense whiplash because they structure their bodies in a very similar way to me, just with a lot more practice and experience. i don't really do much furry art but i reckon their anatomy shorthand would be really useful for me to work on my own stylisation

i've had this tab with this character sheet open for probably six months because i just find this character so damn appealing. knebula also has a real mnaster touch with colour, and is a great inspiration for tying colour together for dark skinned characters

these are truly incredible, such a good kickstart for character design inspiration. the amount of fussing and research and raw imagination required for these kinds of designs is frankly staggering

again with the character design with a cool anatomy shorthand. their creature designs are also really compelling and are consistent with their overall look

someone rustled up a huge load of female versions of the tf2 mercenaries in the tf2 source code leak back in 2020, and to the best of my knowledge this is the most convenient way to look at them. i love the way the character traits are communicated visually, and the pics are also just great inspiration for drawing similar characters in the future

deppa has this incredible flexibility as someone who is clearly incredibly skilled, but is able to give their art extra punch by drawing with a more casual look. their style fluctuates a lot, but they seem to largely work in pen, brush pen, and 1px digital tools and in monochrome. they use a lot of black infill, which is also something i'd like to experiment with

i think theres a sizeable skill gap between me and this artist which is both depressing and relieving. the amount of confidence with these strokes is very indicative of a deep understanding of anatomy and posing and i'm not quite there yet, but this is a nice place to study

this is like a perfect practice reel for expressions. the artist is quite fun with them in general so i might give them more of a look

this is an awesome repository of some normiecore / comfiecore fits that i think would make for great inspiration or reference. i can't save them to pinterest for some reason so theyre going here.

**i can't find a source for this one**

i actually did a long legs and yaoi hands pic like this completely unplanned the other day and its a style i'd really like to keep exploring. if you know where it's from let me know in the guestbook!

also nishio nanoro does heaps of cool mechs and medieval armour but they do feel a _little_ out of my skill level

these reference sheets are super useful for inspiration and study from a particular artist as it gives a bunch of ideas all at once and also lets you compare the same art style from different angles and poses

murninator does these lovely hands that i really want to emulate, as well as good anatomy and simplification techniques for anthro characters. some excellent poses too a la

these sketches are honestly insane theres some really nice realistic anatomy merged with pretty simplified faces and a fun variety of costume and expressions. a lot of these characters also have curly hair which is something i'm trying to work on at the moment

i'm really into the simplification methods and the curvy style of all the clothing in this pic - almost no straight lines. the artist also does heaps with floating / falling poses which is something i want to use more in the future

mauler draws these incredibly solid and chunky looking bone and muscles masses. very bridgman esque. theres also a lot of progress photos which are super nice for learning
