### ðŸ”ž warning! some of this stuff will be nsfw or include art that is nsfw ðŸ”ž
thats just art baby people! are naked a _lot_ as it turns out

welcome to the infinite nightmare list aka a big dumpster for me to put art related stuff that i want to revisit at some point. each section should have a reason that i want to revisit a link. also, i will probably just take images directly from the source so if shit is broken then that would be why

i'm really into the simplification methods and the curvy style of all the clothing in this pic - almost no straight lines. the artist also does heaps with floating / falling poses which is something i want to use more in the future

mauler draws these incredibly solid and chunky looking bone and muscles masses. very bridgman esque. theres also a lot of progress photos which are super nice for learning
