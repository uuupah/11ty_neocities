huge homepage redesign! i'll write about it in some more detail but i'm currently at work and should really be finishing up my tasks instead

my general situation has stabilised a lot so i'm planning on doing a lot more on the site. i'm inspired by [desert jaguar](https://desertjaguar.casa/)'s scraps vs thoughts layout and i plan to keep migrating lists from my bookmarks and obsidian to the site - it feels like a great way to keep them in a centralised spot for my own use, as well as hopefully share some neat stuff with people who might not have seen them. i am finding the colour scheme is a little muddy for pages like [cool game links](/lists/cool_game_links) so i'm going to toy with the colour scheme a little bit in the next couple of days

sorry for the lack of new posts! my life has been a little crazy recently between a lot of personal commitments and a lot of events going on this time of year. i'm taking part in an art exhibition in a month and a half which is very exciting, but it means that most of my art is iterative work on the same concepts that isn't desperately interesting to look at. i've been playing a lot of satisfactory and a lot of splatoon 3!

put in a new music post today; its a bit shorter than they normally are, but that's partly because i was somewhat musically distracted this month (read the post to see why), and because i have a couple of other posts in the works. keep an eye out for a blog post, a game post, and maybe something new

started playing tunic, i think i'm going to drop cave story because monster x is outrageously difficult. took part in this weekend's splatfest (go team power!). started watching girl's last tour, joshiraku and skip and loafer. went to an art exhibition and watched a painting tutorial, and completed a [drawing of the artist](/art/my-art-2023/) that i'm pretty proud of

added a pic of matt stephenson to the [my art](/art/my-art-2023/) page. the lighting is all whacked because it's winter now and the natural light just aint what it was earlier this year. also started the infinite nightmare page to store all the artists i keep sending to myself in dms

finished this month's music post, and started watching asteroid in love as background noise for late night sketching: it is one of the most soulless and generic anime i have ever seen

watched for a few dollars more; vast improvement on a fistful of dollars

started playing devil daggers and cave story +
