this isn't exactly groundbreaking, but my goal with recording recipes is completeness. nagi's chinese dumplings taste amazing and are really straightforward to make! rehydrating the shiitake and buying garlic chives from an asian grocer were absolutely worth the trouble

### ingredients
- 5 – 6 dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 ½ cups finely chopped Chinese cabbage (Napa cabbage)
- ½ tsp salt
- 250 g / 0.5 lb fatty pork mince (20 – 30% fat ideal)
- ¼ cup garlic chives , finely chopped
- 2 tsp light soy sauce (light or dark soy also ok)
- 1 1/2 tsp Chinese wine
- ½ tsp sesame oil
- ¼ tsp white pepper (black also ok)
- 1 garlic clove , minced
- ½ tsp grated fresh ginger
- 30 – 35 round dumpling wrappers
- 1/2 cup water per batch
- 4 – 6 tsp vegetable oil

### method
#### prep
1. shiitake mushroom: place the mushrooms in a bowl and pour over plenty of boiled water. leave for 20 minutes or until rehydrated. squeeze out excess water, then finely chop.
2. cabbage: place cabbage in a bowl with salt. toss with fingers, then set aside for 15 minutes. squeeze out excess liquid from cabbage using hands.
3. filling: place cabbage, mushrooms and remaining filling ingredients in a bowl. mix with your hands until well combined.

#### Make Dumplings (watch video + see photos in post):
1. peel one wrapper off and place on the palm of your left hand (if right handed). dip your finger in water and run it along half the edge of the wrapper.
2. place 1 heaped tablespoon of Filling in the centre. fold wrapper over, then pleat to seal. alternatively, just press together with no pleats.
3. finish so the dumpling is curved slightly, see photos in post, with the pleats on the top.
4. place on tray. cover with cling wrap or wet tea towel (important). repeat with remaining dumplings. should make 30, if yours are extremely plump you may only make 25.

#### Cooking:
1. make sure your pan has a lid that fits it half decently.
2. heat 2 tsp oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat. add dumplings, pressing down firmly to flatten the base onto the pan. cook around 8 to 10 per batch.
3. when the base is golden brown (check them), add 1/2 cup of water into the pan.
4. immediately clamp the lid on, then leave for 7 minutes (any less and the pleats won’t be cooked through so if your water dries out, add a bit more).
5. remove lid – most of the water should be evaporated, the pleats should be cooked through. Leave the pan on the stove until the base dries and the underside of the dumplings are once again crisp.
6. remove dumplings from pan and transfer to serving plate. repeat with remaining dumplings.
7. serve with dipping sauces of choice.
