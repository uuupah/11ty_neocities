i got this recipe from an instagram reel - one of the good ones that actually gives you a written recipe. i had a cheese and potato bake in my mind's eye when making it but the final product is closer to a quiche or frittata. quiche is actually on the short list of foods that i don't really care for, but i warmed up to this really quickly! we served it with an uber simple leafy salad, milk rolls and a red wine. the recipe didn't really require any adjustment, but i wouldnt put dill on top of your final layer of potatoes because it'll burn in the oven. this volume served four adults pretty comfortably

### ingredients:
- 800g waxy potatoes
- 1 onion
- 300ml cream
- 100ml milk
- 3 eggs
- 240g smoked salmon
- 100g butter
- 1 bunch of fresh dill, minced

### method:
1. peel the potatoes and boil in salted water until fork-tender. let cool, then slice (you _should_ just air cool this, but i dunked the potatoes in cold water and they were pretty instantly cool enough to work with. i also didnt let the potatoes cook 100%, the bigger ones still had a bit of resistance right in the middle, but they get cooked again so this isn't a big deal).
2. thinly slice the onion and cook in the butter until soft, reserving the melted butter.
3. whisk together cream, milk, and eggs, seasoning with salt and pepper.
4. layer the sliced potatoes, smoked salmon, cooked onions, and fresh dill in a baking dish, pouring a bit of the cream mixture between each layer. finish with a final layer of the cream mixture on top.
5. bake at 175Â°C for about 30 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbly.
6. drizzle with the reserved melted butter and garnish with a sprinkle of fresh dill.
