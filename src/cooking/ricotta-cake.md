i feel like this is the real benefit of putting recipes up on the blog - taking video-based recipes and un-videoing them. my partner and i made this ricotta cake for a friends birthday and the texture was extremely good - hovering somewhere between a conventional flour and a cheesecake. the strawberries were fun but you could totally swap them for a different one - they would also probably taste better

### ingredients
- 3 large eggs
- 150g sugar
- 1 large lemon, zest
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 120ml vegetable oil (i used extra virgin olive oil here and it tasted great!)
- 285g ricotta cheese, well drained
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 280g all-purpose flour
- 450g strawberries
- powdered sugar, for dusting

### method
1. preheat an oven at 175Â°c
1. select eight or nine of the best looking strawberries and chop them in half. chop remaining strawberries into eighths
2. mix eggs, sugar, lemon and vanilla extract. the recipe uses a hand mixer (granny mixer) but i used a whisk and a stand mixer would also work fine
3. while whisking, drizzle in the oil until combined, then the ricotta
4. add the salt, baking powder and all purpose flour. continue whisking until combined
5. fold through strawberry pieces and pour into a lined cake tin. press the nicer strawberries into the top of the cake
6. bake for an hour. let cool on a counter
7. once the cake is cooled, sprinkle with icing sugar and serve
