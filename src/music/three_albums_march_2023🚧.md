i heard this one on local radio; it's part of a single so its a bit too small for me to put in my top three, but the track is so incredibly groovy that i had to chuck it down here. the bigfoot collective is a 20 piece band based in australia and you've simply got to rep the locals. hopefully i can see them in person some time.

#### solar fields
[listen here](https://solarfields.bandcamp.com/)<br/>
i went absolutely ballistic on solar fields this month, with 274 listens over the 31 days. i've loved them for a really long time and i think i've mentioned my absolute fascination with ultimae records, their publisher and the publisher of a great number of very similar artists. i was first introduced to their work from the mirrors edge soundtrack, and then the absolutely stellar mirrors edge catalyst soundtrack back in 2016. the really nice thing about their sound is its consistency; i tend to gravitate to artists that have consistent tone throughout their discography, or at least over the span of three or four albums. this means i can really appreciate their work for a couple of hours, and also keeps the music from being jarring if i'm listening to it during work hours. 

i have a spotify playlist that's basically just every full album from solar fields, and then listened to them exclusively for a couple of days back in the start of march. solar fields' particular vibe is slightly more upbeat than your average ambient track, although it hits a lot of the same boxes ([everynoise](https://everynoise.com/artistprofile.cgi?id=7GyhmlEy51sGUE09A5AWzc) classifies them as ambient trance, downtempo, space ambient and """psychill""" (i still have a serious aversion to any genre with chill in the name)). this means that it's not always the best music for a certain type of work and i find it a bit too distracting in some cases, but if i really have the momentum up then it's a great time. 

besides that, i don't really have anything super incredible to say about them, except that they're one of my favourite artists and that they're well worth a look. i think [their new stuff](https://solarfields.bandcamp.com/album/formations) is really nice, or you can try out some of their classics like [blue moon station](https://solarfields.bandcamp.com/album/blue-moon-station).
