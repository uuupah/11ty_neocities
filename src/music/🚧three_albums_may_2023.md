i think (embarassingly) that this album caught my attention because the first track, hellebore, sounds initially like something from the dark souls soundtrack. the string melody fading in and out of the piece in layers reminds me of [firelink shrine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJhVgB_H-Q8), but thankfully the rest of the album isnt just aping this same aesthetic

### 2. hello, my name is pipotaku - pipotaku

### other musical musings

#### the skyrim soundtrack minus the skyrim soundtrack  
anyone who has had the misfortune of digging into [my last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/uuupah/library/albums) might have noticed an absurd trend in my listening habits: close to 10% of the music i have listened to in the last five years has been the skyrim soundtrack. i could gush for hours about how well composed this score is (and i probably will at some point), but it A. makes my spotify wrapped look very embarassing and B. doesnt really contribute to my media literacy in a meaningful way  

my solution? create the skyrim soundtrack without using the skyrim soundtrack

now there are plenty of half assed equivalents to this kind of project, where someone grabs six albums that sort of sound similar to something else and just call it a day, but because this is something i want to listen to regularly, im taking it deadly serious. i'm being very precise about tone, volume modulation and the instruments used in each track, and being quite brutal with cutting out tracks that aren't quite there. i'm also trying to avoid artists whose whole thing is to just make music that sounds like game score (scorewizard in particular), just because it sort of feels like cheating; ZXi want the final product to also be a great source of new inspiration for easing people out of the soundtrack space and into the larger world of ambient music, and that kind of work doesnt really assist that task

this is still a huge work in progress and will probably continue to be so for a while, but blog readers will definitely be the first to know when it's finished

#### nadia birkenstock

i have a soft spot for hippie instruments. there, i said it. the harp, hand pan and marimba all have this natural warmth that i simply cannot go past. i suspect that the prepared piano also scratches that itch, hence kelly moran making it big on the list this month. i had the sincere intention to dive into nadia birkenstock this month, so much so that i put her name on the early draft of this blog four or so weeks ago, but that didnt end up happening  

#### trauma center 2

this track is delightful, end of thought
