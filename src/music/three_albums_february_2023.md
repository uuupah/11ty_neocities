[my monthly playlist for feb 23](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vk88QNysxGGbPj1G9UPhN)

as the playlist suggests, i listened to quite a bit of new stuff this month. some of it was bad, some of it was reminding myself what noisia sounds like, some of it was my playboi carti friend continuing to try to convert me. i actually had a really tough time narrowing down the list this time, so i wanted to put in a couple of honourable mentions: 
<br/>
<br/>
#### _farveblind - all clubs are bastards_
[listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ3bccOqB0I&list=OLAK5uy_nfVRZAtqzIUf-L5B2GL5E23UXAtDsNGog)<br/>
a bit of danish electropop never hurt anyone, but this one dodge the list because it wasn't really the most unique experience. i do love lucy love's feature on rock 'n rolla and the general vibe of the whole album is very upbeat, but it's definitely not coming out out at the next experimental night.
<br/>
<br/>
#### _noise0002 - eldia_
[listen here](https://eldia000.bandcamp.com/album/noise0002)<br/>
variety is also the name of the game here, as this is a guest feature album. it's also a breakcore piece, which means that it has the appealing fast tempo and punchy drums, but also the kind of questionable quality on some tracks that you get with genres with a low barrier to entry. the first half of the album has a lot of dreamy """chill""" tracks that i really enjoyed, but the inconsistency of the second half is what kept it off of the podium for me.
<br/>
<br/>
#### _compositions for piano - the flashbulb_
[listen here](https://theflashbulb.bandcamp.com/album/compositions-for-piano)<br/>
this one was a spotify recommendation based on my drill and bass / idm / `genres are stupid experience` with [µ-ziq](https://mikeparadinas.bandcamp.com/album/lunatic-harness-25th-anniversary-edition) and [squarepusher](https://squarepusher.bandcamp.com/). it seems that the flashbulb has heaps of other works in that kind of genre neighbourhood, but compositions for piano is more conventional modern classical, maybe with a little bit of a twist as a result of the flashbulb's pedigree.

okay, now for the actual top 3
