this is likely going to be a shorter post than usual, but this month's playlist is [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7EMFyjdCmvrF2q2q8mvKJ6?si=e8fccb3f063f4699)  

### 3. sinnohvation - insaneintherainmusic

this is maybe a bit more cheesy and self-indulgent than usual, but it's been a really big month and i needed some shameless nostalgia to fall back on.

orchestral reimaginings of scores is hardly new, but it's largely the brainchild of a guy with a single daw who thinks he can really give that classic track the extra punch it had been missing. sinnovation goes in the exact opposite direction, and sticks really close to the vibe of the [go ichinose, hitomi sato et. al.](https://youtu.be/b7oDZaUEoNo) original. the difference is that insaneintherain employed multi-track composition done by both him and other performers, as well as the help of a full orchestra for a couple of tracks. while i'm a huge fan of unmodified game score, i think that this might actually be the better experience

### 2. comfortable silence - tomcbumpz

this album / ep is full of a bunch of little musical sketches, and that is my only real complaint with them: i think each track is so lovely and evocative that i would love to see them all fleshed out properly and given time to shine. technically speaking they don't even appear to be that complicated, with each piece only having a handful of tracks in total, but they're woven on top of each other in a way that lets the imagination run wild. i implore you to close your eyes for ten minutes and imagine alien forests or exploring a cave of phosphorescent mushrooms

### 1. odyssée - jordane tumarinson

i feel incredibly predictable rounding out yet another month with yet another solo piano album, but the heart wants what the heart wants. jordane has an incredible skill for storytelling with a single instrument. the album has a classical backbone, and some tracks (e.g. momentum) lean in on it more than others, but jordane brings in a modern feel to the whole arrangement

this album came out of my local scene and i found it a really pleasant surprise; i normally have little interest in mumble rap, but some of the tracks really threw me for a loop here with some crazy inventive production.
