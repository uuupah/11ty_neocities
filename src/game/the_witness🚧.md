- potentially one of my favourite games so far this year
- exploration
   - myst
- puzzles always felt like they were easily explained
- you need the perspective that if something is really difficult, you're probably not meant to be there yet
   - if it's in the middle of a section then just stepping away and doing something else generally helps
   - otherwise, the game really babies you through the beginning of a rule and if you're not being babied then 

# joseph anderson
- i love joseph but this is one of his weaker videos
- gripes were presented as design issues
- 'i didnt get the sound puzzles'
   - brute forcing instead of experimenting to work out what's going on
- complaining about optional puzzles being a waste of time despite them clearly being for completionists
- josephs habit of playing a game to abs0lute completion bites him in the ass here
   - 'they made a game where the ridiculous endgame stuff pushes the line of what's fun to play' like no shit
