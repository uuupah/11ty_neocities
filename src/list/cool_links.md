in the early 80s, sega, nintendo and atari had a stranglehold on the videogame market, and by extension, the kinds of games that could easily be distributed to the public. the pc-9800 series of japnaese personal computers caused a bit of a renaissance in htis era, as it allowed people to bypass publication requirements for other systtems and make whatever a developer could dream up (within the physical limitations of the hardware). this caused a bit of a renaissance of extremely slick pixel art productions, and this site records the vast majority. also check out [thor high heels' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVpX2y6KjwA) on the pc-98 for some more eye candy.
