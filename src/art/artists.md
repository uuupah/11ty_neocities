i find my """artistic journey""" and """""artistic goals""""" are pretty hard to grasp; i don't think i'm the kind of person who has some great unique thing to say that hasnt been said before, and my insecurity about my skill means that i find it pretty difficult to experiment. i guess i just want to make things that look neat, but i want to stay genuine while doing it, whatever that means

anyway further to that point, heres some of artists that inspire me. i think almost all of them have occasional nsfw posts so consider yourself warned

stedilnik has this delightful grimey style that really fits the darker themes of a lot of their art. mostly pure blacks and whites, heavy hatchwork in a similar manner to those people who do big traditional pieces with ball point pens. this also allows them to use some cute internal contrast when they use this dark style for something quite wholesome and pleasant! stedilnik has a rotating cast of characters who are all really endearing (or at least interesting) which is something that i would love to achieve myself

tyto alba is an artist that clearly has a really good grasp of anatomy, as well as a great visual shorthand for making all of the different elements look appropriately stylised. i think the mech pilot look is really neat and its something that i would like to explore in the near future, so theyre great for inspiration on that front

i sometimes find myself frustrated when i'm having trouble drawing a character from a certain angle, and i find hou jae04 a nice reminder that i can simply stick to what works if i really want to; that probably sounds a little disparaging, but i truly love their focus on a consistent look, because it frees up your creativity for new character designs. i also really love the thick lines look they're going with because it suits the a5 format that i prefer working in immensely

seita inoue is more of a general style inspiration and just an artist that i love looking at because they feel completely out of my league. there style is super recognisable because theyre art director for splatoon, and their line-free digital painting style shows up in heaps of the promotional material and artbooks

i really love nobby's approach to minimally anthropomorphising their furry characters and how they like working with a variety of body shapes in general. they unfortunately seem to be on indefinite hiatus ðŸ˜”

the very worst thing is potentially one of the most creative artists on this list. i'm always amazed at how they can pull a new twist on a character design to create something simultaneously otherworldly and familiar
