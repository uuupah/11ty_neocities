title: "my favourite artists"
draft: true

i find my """artistic journey""" and """""artistic goals""""" are pretty hard to grasp; i don't think i'm the kind of person who has some great unique thing to say that hasnt been said before, and my insecurity about my skill means that i find it pretty difficult to experiment. i guess i just want to make things that look neat, but i want to stay genuine while doing it, whatever that means

anyway further to that point, heres some of artists that inspire me. i think almost all of them have occasional nsfw posts so consider yourself warned

stedilnik has this delightful grimey style that really fits the darker themes of a lot of their art. mostly pure blacks and whites, heavy hatchwork in a similar manner to those people who do big traditional pieces with ball point pens. this also allows them to use some cute internal contrast when they use this dark style for something quite wholesome and pleasant! stedilnik has a rotating cast of characters who are all really endearing (or at least interesting) which is something that i would love to achieve myself
