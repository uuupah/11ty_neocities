    "description": "this one is a cannibalised apple extended keyboard, including original alps orange switches. the spacebar was yellowed to a deep caramel colour, but i did my first [retrobright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrobright) attempt and i reckon it turned out pretty good! the keyboard itself feels and sounds really good, and going through the effort of importing an extra caps lock key from the states to use as short right shift was absolutely worth the trouble - the guy who sent them to me is a semi-retired physics (i think) professor who included a load of other fliers and cds from his various interests to get the package to its minimum weight. i might hunt them down some time and share them here because theyre honestly pretty interesting"

    "description": "you know youve sunk to a new level of stupid when you get this excited about a numpad, but the rf23u is an incredible tool if you need to slap huge amounts of numbers into a spreadsheet. having the esc, backspace, tab and shift keys up the top gives a lot of utility that is normally missing and would require a second hand, and the dedicated = and 00 keys speed up functions and big number respectively. this one has been modded with bke redux domes, but i think theyre a little loud and fatiguing, and will probably swap them back if i ever go back to an office job"

    "description": "and finally, probably my most expensive keyboard project. i got the case cnc milled at a chinese fab for something like 600 australian dollars, which was a pretty silly thing to do. the board inside is an xd96, and i actually had to update the official qmk repo because they didnt have all of this boards layouts available. the switches are just cherry clears, and the keycaps are 'simpleja' which are just an expanded set of standard japanese office keyboard keys that a friend gifted me. the heavy and expensive case thankfully makes it feel really solid, but it doesnt get heaps of use anymore since i dont use my numpad in most day-to-day tasks"
