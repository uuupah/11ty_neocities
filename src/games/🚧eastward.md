- aesthetic
- music
- story
  - john's trauma
  - sam's saccharine perspective
- gameplay
  - combat
    - game punishes you for just wailing on enemies,
    - swing cooldown makes it hard to move after swinging
  - story scenes
- why i kept coming back
  - game can be a bit slow, but charm is high
  - game is also not that intriguing to begin with , but i think thats because 
  of the aforementioned saccharine perspective shifting all the intrigue to the 
  background
  - got put down a couple of times
  - combat can be surprisingly challenging
