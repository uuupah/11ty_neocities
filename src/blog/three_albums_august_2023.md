i _love_ punk music, it's one of the genres most consistently easy to see live, and one of the genres that is most consistently decent live (not always good, but very rarely offensive). similarly, i find punk music consistently a really fun listen, even though some punk heads would probably label a lot of the stuff i've listened to as hacky or whatever

fontaines dc also ties into my feelings about certain genres just sounding _right_ with certain accents / different sources. rap music should be sung with an american accent and punk music should be performed by people from the british isles. brits have been a cornerstone of the punk aesthetic, but irish people have even more charm because they have significantly more reasons to be anti-establishment after their storied history on that small pair of islands

skinty fia is one of the more popular fontaines dc albums but i honestly listened to all of their stuff this month. it's all super solid (and is actually maybe a little more post-punk than punk-punk) and has made for a decent break from the ambient hellhole i fell into a couple of months back

### 2. lumina - dreyma

i mentioned my [skyrim soundtrack minus the skyrim soundtrack playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/65Zz0fFlrTOtBDt5O8bVBR?si=b006ef6194264f00) a couple of months ago, and after doing more digging i fell into two artists that really feel like they effectively represent the particular jeremy soule feel, being [askii](https://askii.bandcamp.com/) and dreyma. both are an excellent listen if you really like soule's work, but lumina is one of the most consistent out of the lot (and ironically, does a better job of the skyrim vibe than Chapter II, an album literally subtitled "jeremy soule inspired music"). like that pokemon album a couple months ago, this is totally just a self indulgent act, but all work and no play makes jack a very dull boy

### 1. unoja - nicola conte

i have no idea how i stumbled onto nicola conte, but he's one of the most fun artists i've listened to in a long time. his music is acid jazz with some heavy bossa nova elements, and is one of the first albums with vocals that i've been able to listen to while working, which is a great positive. i don't actually heaps of interesting stuff to say about it, so i would recommend you just give it a listen!
