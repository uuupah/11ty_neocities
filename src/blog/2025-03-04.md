you get one album this month! consider yourself warned ðŸ«µ
### pezzi della sera - marco castello

### youtube shakeup
i work from home, so i end up watching a lot of youtube while just noodling around. 
- watch lots of youtube because i work from home
- nonstop torrent of nerd shit
- shifted to interior design, vlogs and self help videos and jesus christ its so nice
- got me thinking about improving my sleep habits etc
- i need to focus on finding ways to eat until i feel full
  - should i start bringing snacks in my bag?

### moving
i moved houses a bit over a month ago! i think i always forget how shit the experience of having all my shit disorganised and in boxes makes me feel, but ive done it three times in the last 12 months. layer that with realising that, despite being pretty vigilant about clutter and unnecessary possessions, i should get rid of 30% of my books and 50% of my clothes, and the headache of changing your address with your bank and work and drivers license. 

this lack of stability is pretty new to me, although im starting to get a lot better at at feeling less attached to a singular spot, which is probably good. home is where the heart is, like they said in episode 4, season 1 of madeline (the animation about the french boarding school). i'm also living further from the cbd which makes seeing shows and gettting to work a bigger pain in the ass. 

- moving stresses me the fuck out
- lack of stability is new
- living away from town sucks
- novelty is fun
- living with new people for the first time in probably five years
- a smaller world maybe suits me?

### love letter to musicbee
- unsubscribed from spotify
- interface that works amazingly for me
- unbelievably lightweight (program is only 9.2mb)
- is a good player but also includes:
  - format resampling
  - file renaming and file moving according to metadata
  - metadata searches

### doodads
- gameboy camera
- digicam
- psp
- dsi
- walkman

### little things
- starr and nfs
  - new house has wired networking and really nice router so i can happily have a server on one device and storage on another
- nobara linux and micro pcs
- this is how you lose the time war
  - lovely poetic writing and an amazing backdrop for a beautiful rmonace
  - accidentally read my second piece of genre defining lesbian sci fi in a row
  - absolute surprise but a great way to start the year
- superliminal
  - another cute surprise
  - experience is short but sweet
  - ends WAY better than most puzzle games and despite it feeling very portal-like to begin with it ended in a direction which was both unique and had real weight

### relationships
- i know you're reading this lucien! dont judge me!
- after a bunch of back and forthing ive spent more time with the aforementioned person
- and it has been fucking awesome
- spent an entire 48 hour stretch with them over the weekend where we saw a bunch of shows and made eachother breakfast and went swimming at midnight
