you get one album this month! consider yourself warned ðŸ«µ
### pezzi della sera - marco castello

### youtube shakeup
i work from home, so i end up watching a lot of youtube while just noodling around. 
- watch lots of youtube because i work from home
- nonstop torrent of nerd shit
- shifted to interior design, vlogs and self help videos and jesus christ its so nice
- got me thinking about improving my sleep habits etc
- i need to focus on finding ways to eat until i feel full
  - should i start bringing snacks in my bag?

### moving
i moved houses a bit over a month ago! i think i always forget how shit the experience of having all my shit disorganised and in boxes makes me feel, but ive done it three times in the last 12 months. layer that with realising that, despite being pretty vigilant about clutter and unnecessary possessions, i should get rid of 30% of my books and 50% of my clothes, and the headache of changing your address with your bank and work and drivers license. 

this lack of stability is pretty new to me, although im starting to get a lot better at at feeling less attached to a singular spot, which is probably good. home is where the heart is, like they said in episode 4, season 1 of madeline (the animation about the french boarding school). i'm also living further from the cbd which makes seeing shows and gettting to work a bigger pain in the ass. that said, living with new people for the first time in like five years has definitely been great for my development as a human being. i stayed on a couple of couches after the breakup and am now living in my second semi-permanent share of the last 12 months, and its been a huge learning experience for how different people live. that maybe sounds a bit alien-living-amongst-the-humans but it's cool! most importantly, i think it makes my expectations for living with others way more realistic. the novelty of the whole thing is also a lot of fun.

### doodads
#### gameboy camera
i got this in japan! its in very good condition, but is only in japanese, which makes the menus absolutely fucking unintelligible. it's a super fun thing to mess about with and has got me a couple of really sweet photos and like fifteen times as many terrible ones. it behaves best with single subjects that are well lit but not super reflective (ignore my examples below that are both super reflective). there's loads of interesting modifications you can do to them liek the [2bittoy shell](https://2bittoy.carrd.co) which i am kind of keen on, but only if i could minimise the cost
#### digicam
i knew i wanted to get a digicam in japan and this was one of the first ones i found for less than a hundred bucks. 
#### psp
i also got this in japan! follow the trend! like everything else it is locked to japanese, although i think you can jailbreak them to change language. the strangest difference with these is that the japanese options use circle to confirm and x to cancel, but australia is the opposite (and i assume other english speaking countries). this actually makes a lot of sense because a circle is more commonly used as an affirmative icon than a checkmark in japan, and x as a negative is kind of universal. anyway, i haven't gotten around to using it a great deal because i need to buy more storage, but i gather modding them is pretty straightforward
#### dsi
jokes on you! i actually bought this years ago! it turns out you can buy a psp for like a hundred bucks in australia with very little trouble - this one was basically new and has never given me any trouble. internet people talk a lot about how easy it is to mod a 3ds but the dsi is just as easy and, in my opinion, has a better game library. i started playing ghost trick while i was overseas and it was incredible, and the dinky little camera also snagged these photos for me
#### walkman
i lost my m300 on a train in japan! fucking whoops!! two hundred bucks down the drain right there. luckily, id picked this little character up at a hard off a couple of days prior for a measly 12000 yen, and i had a spare sd card preloaded with music because, come on. look at me (i don't actually remember why, but i still dont think it's that surprising). these walkmans are awesome, and primarily improve on the m300 by having better buttons (the m300 bizarrely uses rocker switches for play and back, and doesnt come with a forward button) but its battery life is noticeably worse, its just small enough that its a bit of a pain to use with my bigass hands and it only goes up to android 10, which leaves an annoying bug that means you can't use syncthing to keep your library in sync over wifi. all this said, it was cheap, and its cute

### love letter to musicbee
i've talked about shifting to downloaded audio for a while now but i realised the other day that i hadn't used spotify in a week or so. my ex recently took themselves off our joint spotify account and i was going to have to change it anyway, so i decided this was the moment to can my subscription. the process was pretty painless due to my prior planning and all the hardware i've bought - i wouldnt recommend it to anyone on a complete whim. all this faff aside, i really want to talk about the massive amount of appreciation it's given me for one piece of software:

musicbee is simultaneously a barebones no-nonsense music player and an extremely powerful music organisation tool. the interface is excellent for me: i'm a chronic album listener so i can get a full feed of all my album art (with easy to recognise album art) and i can filter by artist using the list on the left. i can then drag full albums into the queue on the right and then not think about music for multiple hours. the whole interface is really clean and straightforward and isn't trying to be something slick and classy - it's just a simple and easy to understand tool! and the whole thing is only 9.2MB?

talking about tools, musicbee gives you a bunch of little functions to make organising locally downloaded music hilariously straightforward. i have albums sorted by date added, so new albums flow to the top. i can select each album and 

- unsubscribed from spotify
- interface that works amazingly for me
- unbelievably lightweight (program is only 9.2mb)
- is a good player but also includes:
  - format resampling
  - file renaming and file moving according to metadata
  - metadata searches
  
i will say that the convenience of spotify as a music _archive_ is hard to pass up on. i do still have a free account for finding out the most popular albums from a particular artist and for looking up the names of songs i forgotten, but thats currently about it. if i need to check out a song on short notice youtube and bandcamp do the trick

### little things
- starr and nfs
  - new house has wired networking and really nice router so i can happily have a server on one device and storage on another
- nobara linux and micro pcs
- this is how you lose the time war
  - lovely poetic writing and an amazing backdrop for a beautiful rmonace
  - accidentally read my second piece of genre defining lesbian sci fi in a row
  - absolute surprise but a great way to start the year
- superliminal
  - another cute surprise
  - experience is short but sweet
  - ends WAY better than most puzzle games and despite it feeling very portal-like to begin with it ended in a direction which was both unique and had real weight

### relationships
- i know you're reading this lucien! dont judge me!
- after a bunch of back and forthing ive spent more time with the aforementioned person
- and it has been fucking awesome
- spent an entire 48 hour stretch with them over the weekend where we saw a bunch of shows and made eachother breakfast and went swimming at midnight
