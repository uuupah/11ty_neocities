### royal milk tea 
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/royalmilktea.webp', 360 %}
this was one of the first things i grabbed and felt pretty indicative of the Standard Default milk coffee that you can get from a vending machine for 110 yen. it did introduce me to the concept of hot vending machine drinks, something that australia is sorely missing

### suiyobi no neko

this was the first of many two dollar convenience store beers grabbed at 11pm. i grabbed it entirely based on the art (which will become a running theme) but it was a surprisingly nice little belgian wheat beer! cool!

### melting cafe au lait

i grabbed this in the middle of a random suburb in the northeast corner of osaka (near the [otani cemetary](/blog/japan_nightmare_blog/#otani-cemetary))

### cheap mojito
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/mojito.webp', 360 %}
this thing was five bucks (which would be good in australia) but it was a deathly green and tasted like toothpaste. the mint was also not an amazingly good match for the questionable nepalese food we paired it with
