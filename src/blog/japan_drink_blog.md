### royal milk tea 
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/royalmilktea.webp', 360 %}
this was one of the first things i grabbed and felt pretty indicative of the Standard Default milk coffee that you can get from a vending machine for 110 yen. it did introduce me to the concept of hot vending machine drinks, something that australia is sorely missing

### suiyobi no neko
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/suiyobinoneko.webp', 360 %}
this was the first of many two dollar convenience store beers grabbed at 11pm. i grabbed it entirely based on the art (which will become a running theme) but it was a surprisingly nice little belgian wheat beer! cool!

### melting cafe au lait
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/meltingcafeaulait.webp', 360 %}
i grabbed this in the middle of a random suburb in the northeast corner of osaka (near the [otani cemetary](/blog/japan_nightmare_blog/#otani-cemetary)). the whole creme brulee vibe seems like it might be marketing but i think it was honestly pretty successful! again, hot out of the vending machine, again, really nice ona 3 degree day

### sangaria special milkshake
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/sangariaspecialmilkshake.webp', 360 %}
one of my favourite things that i drank in japan, this was a custard flavoured drink with _just_ the right texture to imply custard without actually being custard. i should have brought some back to australia with me

### kyoto lemonade
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/kyotolemonade.webp', 360 %}
entirely normal lemonade. tasted particularly good while trucking our way through some forests out in osaka

### kirin koiwa cocoa
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/kirinkoiwaicocoa.webp', 360 %}
i grabbed one of these after a handful of trips down the ski slope - i'd already came off the skis a couple of times by now and my temperature had dropped considerably. as a drink, perfectly reasonable, nothing to write home about

### kirin salty lychee
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/kirinsaltylychee.webp', 360 %}
this is the last thing i had before i busted my shoulder. i think it was some kind of electrolyte drink but it tasted pretty good! the salts may also not have stuck out to me too much because i probably needed the hydration a that point

### cheap mojito
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/japan_drinks/mojito.webp', 360 %}
this thing was five bucks (which would be good in australia) but it was a deathly green and tasted like toothpaste. the mint was also not an amazingly good match for the questionable nepalese food we paired it with
