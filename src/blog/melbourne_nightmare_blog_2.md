this place has an extremely strong "suburban cafe vibe" - the fitout was clearly fairly new and hypnotically caucasian. not my style in general but not offensive. i did love the deep forest green highlights on everything and it is on busy intersection so it did at least feel really lively. the food unfortunately was _just fine_; the rhubarb danish was clearly yesterday's batch and had an overwhelming nutellex flavour, and the coffee was uncomfortably bitter - a far cry from yesterday's offerings
