all good new year resolutions need to fail in february or march and my resolution to be more on top of blogs has failed spectacularly! for recompense, heres a bumper double music post as well as all the other stupid shit ive been thinking about for the last couple of weeks

### february

i had a surprisingly unelectronic february! i listened to momentary lapse of happily while i friend of mine gave me a (very time consuming) stick and poke, and i think i got recommended sevdaliza because ive listened to arca? i had some fun and exciting relationship troubles in february and there was something surprisingly zen about absolutely saturated my aural senses with something lyrically and musically dense and a little grating. my people time recommendation is a million times more embarassing, as i learned about it from the manga [_amemiya-san_](https://anilist.co/manga/138850/Amemiyasan/) by keiichi arawi (the person who made nichijou). its super long and very cosy and can easily fill a lot of audio space if necessary

### march
<iframe rss-link="https://open.spotify.com/album/4Dla6BuA4NjSBL7Htpwuzl" rss-linkname="john white - self titled album" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4Dla6BuA4NjSBL7Htpwuzl?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<iframe rss-link="https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/a-greater-bliss" rss-linkname="a greater bliss by wordclock" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2467704422/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/a-greater-bliss">A Greater Bliss by Wordclock</a></iframe>

<iframe rss-link="https://marcusfjellstrm.bandcamp.com/album/library-music" rss-linkname="library music by marcus fjellström" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3258365110/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://marcusfjellstrm.bandcamp.com/album/library-music">Library Music by Marcus Fjellström</a></iframe>

my break from electronic music did not turn into a statistically significant pattern, alas, although i did stumble on to a really cute jazz-funk album by john white. i think this one is particularly funny because there have clearly been a load of john whites performing without a pseudonym over the years and spotify hasn't gone to the effort of dilineating them all, [so you can browse a wide variety of genres and skin colours on the official page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CDhDI2GITSu6k9v73BDiI?si=XHSsEoblQe27LVzWybH8jg). wordclock and marcus fjellström sit on two sides of the electronic-ambient coin, with wordclock being interesting and almost narrative, with a big backlog of tracks that are easy to listen to. marcus, on the other hand, provides a variety of interesting and difficult to describe musical experiments (a little more detailed than a sketch) that are musically very competent but not always the most soothing. a really fun experience in any case

### relationships
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/blog/pastry.jpg' %}
<sub>i know this is in bad taste but its also still a little funny</sub>

i doubt too many of you care but i did mention it before so i thought i'd mention that my _very_ long term relationship is on a break! because its one of those fun normal adult relationships its one of those exciting situations where no-one is _really_ at fault which is both nice and also a nightmare because the obvious solution is much less clear. the whole thing is still in flux and i might have something interesting to say when the dust settles but for now my fun piece of advice is to bring issues up early! and if those issues aren't resolved bring them up again! don't nag, but also don't sit on things and hope they get better because that festers into resentment when given enough time

### shoulder
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/blog/shoulder.jpg' %}

a good pal of mine (who helped put together [last years art exhibition](blog/2023-08-23/)) went to the excrutiating trouble of permanently emblazoning this jacob's ladder to my shoulder! i've only had tattoos with a tattoo machine previously and yeah, i wouldn't recommend stick and poke unless it's really small, or the artist is really experienced - they take a really long time and they are noticeably more painful than the alternative. all this said, i'm super pleased with the outcome (and not even because it was free!). it looks a little wonky because of the angle i took this photo at but the overall shape is spot on and the stippling effect gives it a notably organic and homegrown feel that i adore

(readers are now equipped with the knowledge to identify my bloated corpse when it washes on to shore after a horrific 18th century boating accident, and indeed, by reading this sentence, you have entered into a binding contract to do just that)

### rss
i added rss to my site! i dont expect this to get loads of use but its more or less a set-and-forget type system so theres no harm in having it just sitting in the background. as always, the 11ty documentation came in clutch with [a super simple guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) but i've continued to tweak it a little more to my liking. my blog posts tend to be chock full of embedded media (iframes) for youtube, spotify and bandcamp, but feedly doesnt play nicely with them so theres an extra filter that runs over the top to replace iframes with an equivalent link that feed users can use to see the contents of each missing embed. i think [my solution](https://github.com/uuupah/11ty_neocities/blob/3f725f9254f55f3d58704da0e107e4124f63a50e/.eleventy.js#L185) works okay, but there is some kind of annoying behaviour where it seems that every second embed just isnt detected or gets skipped or something. i'll keep working on it because getting my head around jsdom and general node.js functionality is kind of fun, and i also just don't like finishing a project unfinished

### cohost update
[i talked about cohost in a previous post](/blog/tumblr) and how i was pretty primed for it to be my new tumblr replacement - after a month or so i'm still hopeful for its long term success, but i've noted that it seems to have had huge uptake by artists who draw somewhat more spicy art, but doesnt seem to have as many users who make interesting text posts, more normal art, or just have normal aggregator-type accounts. i suppose it doesn't make loads of sense for the average artist to jump ship at the moment because there's nothing _actively_ harming them on tumblr - bit of a shame, and it means that i still spend more time on tumblr, but we shall see how it shakes out in the next year or so

### desko keyboard
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/blog/desko.jpg' %}

i found this little guy on taobao for a cool fifty bucks and snagged it with the intention to convert it into something a smidgen more palatable in 2024 - this keyboard is used at airports for initial sign in staff, and the slot of top is (i believe) a magnetic scanner, or maybe a barcode scanner. i unluckily got a version with a ps/2 connector instead of usb, but i've grabbed a [tinkerboy ps/2 vial adapter](https://www.ebay.com/itm/303710208315) and [a panel mount mini usb adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005292279349.html) to make the whole thing more portable (i'll also be upgrading the keycaps and switches in the fullness of time). i'm still waiting on parts to arrive but i'll probably make a post about the upgrade when it happens - the most interesting part of which will be trying my darnedest to put a split backspace on a pcb mount keyboard - watch this space

### systemctl-bot
i've been thinking about running a minecraft beta 1.7.3 server for my friends for a while, but the dilemma of handling running multiple servers at once had been bouncing around my head - luckily, thanks to the wonders of open source software, someone has already had my _exact_ issue and solved it with [systemctl-bot](https://github.com/forrestjacobs/systemctl-bot): a discord bot that can be configured to manage systemd services on a home server. for the layperson, this means that my friends can send a simple text command on a discord channel and this nifty piece of software will start and stop the appropriate program, making it completely hands off on my side. it can be used to run any program that can run through systemd (read: basically any software) meaning there are probably loads of other creative ways to use it. i've already mentioned this program in my most recent [home server post](/blog/home_server_game__servers) but i'm so psyched about it that i wanted to give it a second shoutout

### some independent animation i thought was fun

i really love both short animations and short comics - i also recently started [a tumblr for the latter](https://www.tumblr.com/squidwithglasses). the bite size nature means you can discuss a single concept or explore a single visual idea but with a super low barrier to entry (at least as far as artistic pursuits go) (also short animations are still a huge undertaking, but a one minute animation is obviously much easier to make than a twenty six minute episode) (i also love animatics for the same reason, although a lot of animators dont seem to love sharing them because they feel 'unfinished' which i suppose is fair)

id really love to make some new site that could store all these sweet vids and comics ive found - tumblr pages and links of youtube pages work but they aren't exactly archival so a downloaded copy would be better. the main issue with that is that some artists might be pretty cheesed about their stuff being hosted somewhere without their permission. a clever fallback system that usees a native youtube or tumblr (or other artsite) embed while the post is up but has a backup in case it goes down might be worth looking into. this concept does have the potential to be a bit space consuming though so it might have to be somewhere outside of this site. again, watch this space

### snail comic
talking about small comics, a friend of mine just put out the first issue of [their little comic](https://snail666.itch.io/snail-comic-issue-1) the other day! it's also [here](https://snailcomic.neocities.org/) if you don't want to download anything. i feel like their scratchy sketchy style might be a little offputting to the average person but i think it meshess super well with their expressive characters and fun worldbuilding. they've also started [a new comic called 'hell'](https://www.instagram.com/snailcomic666/) which seems like it might be a touch more depressing, but equally intriguing
