all good new year resolutions need to fail in february or march and my resolution to be more on top of blogs has failed spectacularly! for recompense, heres a bumper double music post as well as all the other stupid shit ive been thinking about for the last couple of weeks

### february

i had a surprisingly unelectronic february! i listened to momentary lapse of happily while i friend of mine gave me a (very time consuming) stick and poke, and i think i got recommended sevdaliza because ive listened to arca? i had some fun and exciting relationship troubles in february and there was something surprisingly zen about absolutely saturated my aural senses with something lyrically and musically dense and a little grating. my people time recommendation is a million times more embarassing, as i learned about it from the manga [_amemiya-san_](https://anilist.co/manga/138850/Amemiyasan/) by keiichi arawi (the person who made nichijou). its super long and very cosy and can easily fill a lot of audio space if necessary

### march
<iframe rss-link="https://open.spotify.com/album/4Dla6BuA4NjSBL7Htpwuzl" rss-linkname="john white - self titled album" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4Dla6BuA4NjSBL7Htpwuzl?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<iframe rss-link="https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/a-greater-bliss" rss-linkname="a greater bliss by wordclock" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2467704422/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/a-greater-bliss">A Greater Bliss by Wordclock</a></iframe>

<iframe rss-link="https://marcusfjellstrm.bandcamp.com/album/library-music" rss-linkname="library music by marcus fjellström" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3258365110/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://marcusfjellstrm.bandcamp.com/album/library-music">Library Music by Marcus Fjellström</a></iframe>

my break from electronic music did not turn into a statistically significant pattern, alas, although i did stumble on to a really cute jazz-funk album by john white. i think this one is particularly funny because there have clearly been a load of john whites performing without a pseudonym over the years and spotify hasn't gone to the effort of dilineating them all, (so you can browse a wide variety of genres and skin colours on the official page)[https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CDhDI2GITSu6k9v73BDiI?si=XHSsEoblQe27LVzWybH8jg]. wordclock and marcus fjellström sit on two sides of the electronic-ambient coin, with wordclock being interesting and almost narrative, with a big backlog of tracks that are easy to listen to. marcus, on the other hand, provides a variety of interesting and difficult to describe musical experiments (a little more detailed than a sketch) that are musically very competent but not always the most soothing. a really fun experience in any case

### shoulder
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/blog/shoulder.jpg' %}

a good pal of mine (who helped put together [last years art exhibition](blog/2023-08-23/)) went to the excrutiating trouble of permanently emblazoning this jacob's ladder to my shoulder! i've only had tattoos with a tattoo machine previously and yeah, i wouldn't recommend stick and poke unless it's really small, or the artist is really experienced - they take a really long time and they are noticeably more painful than the alternative. all this said, i'm super pleased with the outcome (and not even because it was free!). it looks a little wonky because of the angle i took this photo at but the overall shape is spot on and the stippling effect gives it a notably organic and homegrown feel that i adore

(readers are now equipped with the knowledge to identify my bloated corpse when it washes on to shore after a horrific 18th century boating accident, and indeed, by reading this sentence, you have entered into a binding contract to do just that)

### desko keyboard
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/blog/desko.jpg' %}

i found this little guy on taobao for a cool fifty bucks and snagged it with the intention to convert it into something a smidgen more palatable in 2024 - this keyboard is used at airports for initial sign in staff, and the slot of top is (i believe) a magnetic scanner, or maybe a barcode scanner. i unluckily got a version with a ps/2 connector instead of usb, but i've grabbed a [tinkerboy ps/2 vial adapter](https://www.ebay.com/itm/303710208315) and [a panel mount mini usb adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005292279349.html) to make the whole thing more portable (i'll also be upgrading the keycaps and switches in the fullness of time). i'm still waiting on parts to arrive but i'll probably make a post about the upgrade when it happens - the most interesting part of which will be trying my darnedest to put a split backspace on a pcb mount keyboard - watch this space

### systemctl-bot
i've been thinking about running a minecraft beta 1.7.3 server for my friends for a while, but the dilemma of handling running multiple servers at once had been bouncing around my head - luckily, thanks to the wonders of open source software, someone has already had my _exact_ issue and solved it with [systemctl-bot](https://github.com/forrestjacobs/systemctl-bot): a discord bot that can be configured to manage systemd services on a home server. for the layperson, this means that my friends can send a simple text command on a discord channel and this nifty piece of software will start and stop the appropriate program, making it completely hands off on my side. it can be used to run any program that can run through systemd (read: basically any software) meaning there are probably loads of other creative ways to use it. i've already mentioned this program in my most recent [home server post](/blog/home_server_game__servers) but i'm so psyched about it that i wanted to give it a second shoutout

### some independent animation i thought was fun
