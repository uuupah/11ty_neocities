### gender
i remember when i was early in on tumblr and beginning to learn about transgender identity and genderfluidity and not really _getting_ it. it was the mid 2010s and the modern concepts of transgender people were only just beginning to hit the "mainstream" - toilet-pearls-clutching was in its infancy, and jk rowling hadn't shown all of her cards yet. around this time i was introduced to the concept of "ftf" and "mtm" trans people, a concept that seemed insane back then, but has seemed more and more reasonable as i've continued figuring out my own gender and being surrounded by other lovely genderqueer people

this moment came back to me during the first session with my new electrolysis tech - when i described how i wanted a full removal of my facial hair she asked if i was "changing my gender" and the gulf between how i used to think about being transgender and how i think now became incredibly clear. i think to the uninitiated it seems like someone has been one gender for all of their life and they suddenly realised that they want to try something else, like the other option seems like a better one. for me, as my internal identity began to crystalise, it also became clear that my external identity didn't match. it wasn't like i became non-binary per se, it was more that i realised the feelings i'd had on the inside the whole time had a name, and once i'd figured that i wanted the rest of my life to match (i hope that makes sense lol)

i also went to an artists talk by a really cool enby about their gender-focused exhibition - it was awesome, for reference - but it made me think about how a lot of visual representations of genderqueer-ness seem to focus on fluffy shapes and pastel rainbow forms. i'm suddenly kind of interested in artistic gender expression that is somewhat the opposite - can i show my feelings with a drawing that's dark and spikey and not at all ethereal? i think i could do some super cool human forms with this idea, but also something more somber - perhaps like someone moving through a dark misty mire a-la middle earth?
