- lost notebook this week
  - added a lot of stress
  - did find it again
  - had a surprisingly chilled out weekend
  - got me thinking about how my planning allays some stresses but adds others
  - self-guilt with long term tasks that havent been addressed, generally for good reason
  
- albums
  - not really a "top three" this month, but here are some interesting ones that i found
    - elektel - space travel with teddybear
    - tottomori - shoreline mistward
    - proc fiskal - sire spine sysex
