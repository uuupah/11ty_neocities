this is going to be a bit of a short one, for reasons that will hopefully be clear. i don't really have a good excuse for the lateness though, sorry!

### the month that never was

july was a bit of an unintentional experiment on myself. i somehow managed to lose my common book and bullet journal, found my bullet journal, then lost my (new) common book and bullet journal _again_! the immediate effect of this comedy of errors was that a huge slice of my note taking system that i rely on so heavily was missing for most of the month, and the immediate effect of _that_ wasn't immediate. but it was interesting!

my clearest memory was of a weekend where i was bullet-journal-less and therefore task-less. this coincided with a weekend that was extremely quiet, and instead of freaking the fuck out i played the point and click mystery game [loco motive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1709880/Loco_Motive/)

and it was wonderful! i literally haven't slept this well in potentially years. this of course got me thinking about the benefits and hindrances of my system and wondering whether it's the best for the way i like to live my life. [i've talked about my organisation system here before](/blog/on_organisation), but the short version is that i stick any thoughts in my bullet journal as soon as possible. this keeps thoughts that aren't necessary from sitting in the back of my mind, and gives me a sense of calm knowing that there isn't a task that i've forgotten. i did definitely still have a bit of stress about forgetting about little jobs during the month so i think the system still works, but perhaps it could have some tweaking.

one big thing that i indentified was the way that having "big" projects hanging over my head makes me feel anxious in general, and is probably one of the big things that i should focus on, maybe by moving them to another system or breaking them up more effectively. on the other hand, the trouble that i had with the books missing did help to cement their effectiveness in my mind.

### music

i don't really have a "top three" this month, but here are some interesting albums that i found!
