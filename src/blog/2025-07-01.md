this is going to be a bit of a short one, for reasons that will hopefully be clear. i don't really have a good excuse for the lateness though, sorry!

july was a bit of an unintentional experiment on myself. i somehow managed to lose my common book and bullet journal, found my bullet journal, then lost my (new) common book and bullet journal _again_! the immediate effect of this comedy of errors was that a huge slice of my note taking system that i rely on so heavily was missing for most of the month, and the immediate effect of _that_ wasn't immediate. but it was interesting!

my clearest memory was of a weekend where i was bullet-journal-less and therefore task-less. this coincided with a weekend that was extremely quiet, and instead of freaking the fuck out i played the point and click mystery game [loco motive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1709880/Loco_Motive/)

- lost notebook this week
  - added a lot of stress
  - did find it again
  - had a surprisingly chilled out weekend
  - got me thinking about how my planning allays some stresses but adds others
  - self-guilt with long term tasks that havent been addressed, generally for good reason
  
- albums
  - not really a "top three" this month, but here are some interesting ones that i found
