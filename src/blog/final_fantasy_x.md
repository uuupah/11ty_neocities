when i was in primary school i was friends with a farmer's son. farmers tend to make a big deal about the financial burdens of their business but this kids parents had multiple properties, including a beach house on the waterfront. he also ended up going to a private boarding school for grades 10-12. go figure. anyway, somewhere in year six or seven his parents offered to take me along to their beach house because they needed to do their yearly maintenance on the place. i was there for three days, and did i spend any meaningful time outside, enjoying the ocean or exploring the dunes? of course not! we spent probably 20 hours all told on my friends playstation 2, playing final fantasy x and final fantasy x-2. the beach house was a two story affair but i have no recollection of evening going to the first floor, of eating dinner, of going outside or even of where i slept. i do, however, remember diving headfirst into the worlds of these two games SO deeply that i literally cried when i had to go home, not out of some childlike tantrum, but because it felt like i was losing a friend, being torn away from a beautiful world that i had only just started to explore. this is one of my clearest memories of primary school, it is truly that ingrained on my psyche

i started thinking about final fantasy x again when completing last months top 3 albums - the track eternal lightwaves from gaia/rae remixes a track from final fantasy x-2 directly, and i think its somewhat emblematic of where the ps1/2 revival is currently focusing its energy. extremely deeply rooted childhood nostalgia aside, i truly believe that these two games are something pretty special and worth thinking about.
