i'm kind of uniquely placed financially speaking; i work as a programmer, but most of my friends are artists, teachers or working in healthcare (not as doctors). i prioritise my personal life over my professional one, which is bound to bite me in the ass in the long term, but means that i have a comfortable enough life in the short term. the summary of all this is i get paid more than most of my friends and less than most of my peers. i top off this fun combo with living in australia where houses are considered an investment opportunity instead of a human necessity, and where our distance from the usa and small population means that things are Just More Expensive here. as an upshot owning a house one day is tantalisingly close but practically out of reach. i set out a budget plan this year that would have maybe put me in the running, with the condition that my car and phone kept trucking along long enough that they dont pose a financial pressure. anyway, my car's required a month of saving's worth of repairs, and my phone is getting distressingly fritzy. it stopped charging completely partly through may and i was terrified that i would have to replace it, but a complete drain and charge via wireless fixed it. for some reason. anyway it has slightly felt like the world is against me this may, but things are also coming back to equilibrium. the car acting up led to me buying a bicycle, which is awesome, and the phone acting up has cemented my rejection of it as a multitool. i'm keep my walkman, camera, notebooks and physical cards on me like a perfect little trend-following minimalist, but it's nice to know that i wasnt acting like a prepper for an apocalypse that will never come

i continue to walk the tightrope of doing too little and doing too much. my art output (?? gross) isn't where i'd like it to be, i've got a bunch of fun stuff i want to write about here, a bunch of books i want to read, exercise and training i'd like to do, and i've fallen back on hosting events after moving further from the centre of town. all the while, my weekly schedule looks like this:
