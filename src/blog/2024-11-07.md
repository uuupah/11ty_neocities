### halloween
i have a terrible habit of only getting my best halloween costume ideas on the 20th of october, but i also have a terrible habit of following through with whatever stupid project that's popped into my head. some friends had gone to a gig wearing wizard outfits and the concept of making one of the giant 100 gecs cloaks appeared before me, brought down from above and heralded by a choir of angels. "that shouldnt take _that_ long", i thought, incorrectly.

<sub>the cloaks in question</sub>

my initial thought was to do laura's (purple) cloak because cutting stars to sew to the cloak would be markedly easier than the music notes. my brother (a professional costume designer) thankfully told me i was being stupid and to just use fabric paint for the designs. i switched over the dylan's (yellow) cloak because it would behave better with paint and also give me a good excuse to make the iconic star hat

people recommended this pretty simple (and very cheap) simplicity pattern for the cloak - it's apparently a bit of a universal pattern and has a lot of use as a jedi costume alongside the tunic that's also in simplicity 5480. i haven't actually sewn anything in years but i found it pretty easy to pick up again. i also don't own an iron at the moment so don't judge my creased ass fabric

the whole garment was close to six metres of fabric which initially surprised me, but made a lot of sense when i saw the whole thing put together. the construction itself took five to six hours, but i haven't sewn in a couple of years so a not insubstantial element of the time was relearning how the machine worked and general inefficiency in my technique

next up, the music notes. i made a couple of cardboard templates and outlined them with sharpie. i initially filled them with a tulip fabric paint pen but the amount of bleed was pretty intense, and those pens do _not_ hold very much ink, so i swapped to tulip soft fabric paint instead. thus began a 10h+ journey of painting at the dining table late into the night, but i think it was worth it

last up was the hat! i got the biggest pieces of yellow paper that spotlight sells and glued them to a really big piece of cardboard. my compass doesnt go the full 25cm radius so i picked a centre point, and then marked about fifteen points per quarter revolution, then sketched in the gaps. i also put 14 even points on the inside with a cute lil X=(Ï€D)/14, extended every second point out to the outside of the brim, then

and the whole thing put together! the photo sucks immense ass and the cloak is incredibly creased but yknow, you get the idea. i'd probably put some kind of clasp and even consider adding a lining if i was to wear the costume again, but i got my two nights out of it and thats what's most important. the whole thing folds up _super_ small which is an extra bonus. it'll probably get dragged out again at some future event

this art is so cool! chee fong's grasp on lighting is seriously understated, i love the diffused lighting coming from the screens and the way that the pipes start to pale out as they stretch up into the fog

i feel like ive really cultivated a recent obsession with drawing hands, brobably from [bangtanghan](https://bangtanghan.tumblr.com/) and this animation totally tickles that same itch. it's also super long for an indie project! and makes that absolute most of it. i found it legitimately intriguing how these boys were gonna get out of it, and i really enjoyed all the little illustration touches (like using different styles of screen tone to depict different levels of shadow). it's fun! watch it!

atlus's new not-persona game came out last month! my satisfactory obsession has unfortunately impeded my play time, but at least on an aesthetic front they have absolutely knocked it out of the park again, and the changes to the persona / smt formula seem pretty solid to me!
