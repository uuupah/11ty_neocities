### cramped room of death  
stephen's sausage roll but a dungeon crawler ig?

### breeze in the clouds  
platformer beat-em-up that i can say definitively is not using the anthro look as a cute aesthetic, but because the artists are absolute dyed-in-the-wool furries. that does at least mean that the characters all look super appealing and distinct and have heaps of charm. the music also sounds super cool.

### cataclismo  
from my searching around this game appears to be equal parts fortress builder and adventure game. the former could be really interesting, since it doesnt seem to be a tower defence but something new (at least to me)

### #blud  
noughties style animation in a 2d top down brawler - gameplay is maybe not that unique but its a tried and true formula and the animation might be enough to carry it

### black sword dx  
a really unique look, but more isometric 2d brawler type gameplay

### dordogne  
colour me intrigued, especially after watching 40 trailers i skipped almost immediately

### tako no himitsu  
i dont think ive ever seen a new game capture the gba feel quite as well as this appears to
