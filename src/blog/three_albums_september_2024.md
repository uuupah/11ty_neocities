i had a lot of music i really liked this month but didnt stew on singular albums as much as i would have liked, so heres a ~~cop out~~ bumper crop of albums i really enjoyed, with maybe slightly thinner analysis than normal

[my september 2024 plays](https://www.last.fm/user/uuupah/library/albums?from=2024-09-01&to=2024-09-30)

### black one - sun o)))

i got recommended this band after sagely nodding along to an ambient noise gig - they're apparently pretty well known by those in the metal circles, maybe because of their darker tones? i really enjoy the general arctic / droney vibes, with all their rumbles, screeches, and weird demonic chanting, but also how analog most of it feels, with very clear bass and guitar being used to build the melody

### cross the street - junior varsity

i really like the vibe of this song, and the themes of two people who like each other a lot but arent quite right for each other. it's very telling, however, that theres a lot of money behind this band, because they showed me a SHITLOAD of ads on instagram, and they also dont have a bandcamp, which is very out of the ordinary for a small indie production. whatever, i won't gatekeep

### kitten burst ost - jam2g0
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/three_albums_september_2024/kittenburst.jpg" rss-link="https://jam2go.bandcamp.com/album/kitten-burst-part-c-original-soundtrack" rss-linkname="kitten burst original soundtrack by jam2go on bandcamp" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 320px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3830067622/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://jam2go.bandcamp.com/album/kitten-burst-part-c-original-soundtrack">Kitten Burst [Part C‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã:‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã] (Original Soundtrack) by Jam2go</a></iframe>

i found this album after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uapad3pVxBY) and going "whoa, that music is fucking awesome, i wonder where it's from?" turns out that not only is jam2go exquisitely skilled at putting together videos about video shaders that i barely understand, but they also making some extremely fun music. as one somewhat might expect from a game about flying a cat through a y2k dreamscape, the overall vibe is quite varied and upbeat, but some tracks are also stunningly heavy in a way that i adore. my favourite tracks are probably fall forever and zero day

### smilewound - m√∫m
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/three_albums_september_2024/smilewound.jpg" rss-link="https://mumband.bandcamp.com/album/smilewound" rss-linkname="smilewound by m√∫m on bandcamp" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 320px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1778773713/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://mumband.bandcamp.com/album/smilewound">Smilewound by M√∫m</a></iframe>

this one was just super interesting, a lot of the tracks have a general poppy vibe, but "eternity is the wait between breaths" reminded me of the wakfu soundtrack, of all things, and a bunch of the rest of album reminds me of the scary jokes? really enjoyable

### imaginal disk - magdalena bay
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/three_albums_september_2024/imaginaldisk.jpg" rss-link="https://magdalenabay.bandcamp.com/album/imaginal-disk" rss-linkname="imaginal disk by magdalena bay on bandcamp" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 320px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1709829577/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://magdalenabay.bandcamp.com/album/imaginal-disk">Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay</a></iframe>

they say a good parent doesnt choose between their kids, but imaginal disk was my favourite album of the month. it's pretty uncommon that i listen to an album and have _every_ track make me think "oh boy! i love this track!" but thats totally what imaginal disk does. i loved the lyrics, which is a rarity, as they kind of felt like the musings of someone in their mid-late 20s (which i can empathise with), kind of reassessing yourself and life in general with the short bit of adulthood that you've experienced so far. also, the album cover is kind of a jojo reference

### other stuff
yeah baby! tell me about media! who else loves consuming products???

### sorry we're closed

i know almost nothing about this game and honestly the resident evil style gameplay would potentially turn me off of the whole affair but the ps1 aesthetic and the general modelling / texturing decisions and character design have got me so intrigued. i'll try and grab the demo before next month

### stupid nerdy computer shit
i got two of [these probably questionable mdd refurbished drives](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0D9RMHPDG) for 190 aud each and used them to kick my truenas nas into gear which has been pretty fun to mess with! i much prefer the fine grained control of running a raw headless linux server and i'm probably going to continue using a combo of the two computers, but at the very minimum having this much storage on hand is a great time. i'm probably going to grab some more white label drives next month

talking about my main server, i needed to move it to some new hardware and after having some drive incompatibility issues, i decided to start over, using docker this time. i've previously stuck my nose up at it after having issues with [portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) but i just used docker-compose this time and yeah, i get it. it's nice. there is extra annoyance with setting up storage and network routing, but you do remove the annoyance of setting up service accounts, so its probably a net zero (except the majority of server programs use docker, so you save yourself some trouble in that aspect)

i also installed [lakka](https://www.lakka.tv/) on one of my spare dell optiplex micros and [nobara steam-htpc](https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/) on the other, which lets me run emulators and a clean steam streaming platform on my tv, respectively. both were a minor fiddle to set up but the value of having a dedicated (small) pc for each of these tasks is wonderful. i also grabbed an [8bitdo ultimate controller](https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-bluetooth-controller/) to plug into them and then leave docked next to the tv when i'm not using it and yeah, the hype is there for a reason. theyre really nice controllers

### bro bought a horse
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/three_albums_september_2024/broboughtahorse.jpeg" rss-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWLqLhvJchg" rss-linkname="'bro bought a horse' animation on youtube" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VWLqLhvJchg?si=q772ZXMmAL3pBb-h" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

i should honestly try doing some animation in this style. i love the worthikids inspiration, but also how expressive they can be with such (frankly) janky lines - the perspective used on the horse during the backflip scene is amazingW

### satisfactory

the 1.0 update came out this month. look at my turbofuel factory boy


### me
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/three_albums_september_2024/tagyourself.jpg", "500", false %}

don't have loads of personal updates this month. im maybe doing better? a little bit? i had another big breakdown but my housemate continues to be a beacon through my frayed emotional state. im good now but i'll probably spiral again next time i hang out with my ex - a bit of a running theme. im pretty certain on the fact that i'm not going to go seeking out dates until 2025, and that i think i also need therapy for my self-image issues üëç

all this bitching aside i think ive lined up a share house with some friends of friends which is a huge relief, and might even mean that i'll be able to afford a house in maybe the next five years. i also got up to _loads_ of things irl, watched a shitload of movies with friends and even rekindled a buried love of getting shitfaced, going dancing at the local underground alt bar and giving myself a serious amyl headache
