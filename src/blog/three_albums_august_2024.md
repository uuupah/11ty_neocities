### games
#### mutazione
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/three_albums_august_2024/mutazione.jpg" %}
i first tried playing mutazione more than a year ago. these flavour of game where you walk around a town and get to know everyone's weird business and have interesting interpersonal moments are totally my jam (night in the woods is probably my favourite game ever) and this provides that with its own super unique paper cut-out visual style. i think the opening couple of hours maybe don't grab the average player as well as they could, and the whole thing is very much a visual novel without much need for problem solving, but the overall experience is really lovely and intriguing. i will 100% overlook all kinds of sins if you let me explore a visually interesting world and dig into some weird kinda mundane soap opera level stories. mutazione absolutely scratched my night in the woods itch and i'm now on the hunt for _another_ game to fill that gap

#### disco elysium
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/three_albums_august_2024/disco.jpg" %}
disco elysium also (nominally) fits in the walk-around-a-town genre of game, but frames it as a detective mystery instead. you play as a cop in a familiar but alternate reality who has drunk themselves into almost total amnesia and must figure out what's going on in _the world_ before they can figure out who committed the crime at hand. disco has an absolutely gorgeous smeary oil painting look to the entire game and each character has their own unique portrait that is full of charm (and a little bit unsettling, sometimes). the core system that sets this game apart is your skills being separated into a sort of greek chorus that, depending on your skill in each one, will check in on the situation at hand depending on your proficiency. this creates a perfect thematic move where you feel like you are going slightly crazy and talking to yourself. the game is also structured in a way where taking the weird or "wrong" move is somewhat encouraged due to your character being a bit of a fuck-up, which gives you more freedom to roleplay than ive seen in a lot of other game experiences - it feels like a little thing, but i think it helps disco to stand out as one of the best of its style in recent years

outwardly this one totally looks like a bit of a goof, but theyve done an honestly impressive job at simplifying disco elysium's systems without losing the original vibe, the visuals are also a hidden gem here; i love kim's tiny little chat portrait and how easily it can be read

### food
#### the best corn tortilla recipe ive found yet

this is the only corn tortilla i've ever had any real success with. the advice this youtuber gives is super reliant on detecting issues and adjusting yourself which i think is really key with cooking. he unfortunately doesnt allow for video embedding, but trust me, this one is good. even if you don't get the perfect puff, getting close will still yield an extremely good tortilla

#### chicken karahi

this recipe did result in me spending an hour going to three (3) separate indian grocers looking for fenugreek leaves / methi, but the end result was incredible. if you stumble onto a bunch of fresh tomatoes the flavour of this dish is out of this world and also somehow unbelieveably easy and simple. the 35 minute number promised in the title isn't hyperbole

#### pesto calabrese

finally, this recipe is a little bit of effort, but is totally worthwhile. keep an eye out for cavatappi specifically because it truly heightens the whole experience

i'm writing this post in the zed code editor for linux! i grabbed it on a whim a week or so ago and have (mostly) been pleasantly surprised by the experience.
