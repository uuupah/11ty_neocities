### games
#### mutazione
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/three_albums_august_2024/mutazione.jpg" %}
i first tried playing mutazione more than a year ago. these flavour of game where you walk around a town and get to know everyone's weird business and have interesting interpersonal moments are totally my jam (night in the woods is probably my favourite game ever) and this provides that with its own super unique paper cut-out visual style. i think the opening couple of hours maybe don't grab the average player as well as they could, and the whole thing is very much a visual novel without much need for problem solving, but the overall experience is really lovely and intriguing. i will 100% overlook all kinds of sins if you let me explore a visually interesting world and dig into some weird kinda mundane soap opera level stories. mutazione absolutely scratched my night in the woods itch and i'm now on the hunt for _another_ game to fill that gap

#### disco elysium
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/three_albums_august_2024/disco.jpg" %}
disco elysium also (nominally) fits in the walk-around-a-town genre of game, but frames it as a detective mystery instead. you play as a cop in a familiar but alternate reality who has drunk themselves into almost total amnesia and must figure out what's going on in _the world_ before they can figure out who committed the crime at hand. disco has an absolutely gorgeous smeary oil painting look to the entire game and each character has their own unique portrait that is full of charm (and a little bit unsettling, sometimes). the core system that sets this game apart is your skills being separated into a sort of greek chorus that, depending on your skill in each one, will check in on the situation at hand depending on your proficiency. this creates a perfect thematic move where you feel like you are going slightly crazy and talking to yourself. the game is also structured in a way where taking the weird or "wrong" move is somewhat encouraged due to your character being a bit of a fuck-up, which gives you more freedom to roleplay than ive seen in a lot of other game experiences - it feels like a little thing, but i think it helps disco to stand out as one of the best of its style in recent years
