## or: existence is inherently terrifying
our brains are really good at convincing us that we're these sort of infinite perfect intelligences - the platonic ideal of a soul. injury to your limbs impact the actions you do instinctively, giving you that half a moment of confusion as theres a disconnect between your thoughts and the outcome in the physical world, but you can also understand whats going on pretty quickly and separate it from your "soul". things going on with your internal organs are a bit more mysterious, but they're still not "you". at least not to me

i started down this train of thought the other day after smacking my head on a doorframe and going a bit wobbly for a second. even something pretty simple like letting the blood rush to your head after hanging off the side of the couch impacts that soul's ability to form thoughts or make decisions. and what is our soul but a combination of our thoughts and memories?

- this still works with normal human injury as thats very mechanical
- but its very terrifying when something interferes with our ability to be a thinking human being
- even something as simple as getting a headrush accidentally
- one of the best argumemts ive had for atheism, as horrible as it is
- every time i wake up from a nap i think about death because i just turned my brain off for an hour
  - sleep is the brain preparing itself for death
  

### lucidity
coming back to yourself after an autopilot task

### your senses
the focus point of your vision

### being drunk
