bon voyage 2023! my "next blog" note file is getting huge and my monthly albums are a bit boring, so i'm doing another combo post. i think this is the format i'm going to do next year so i might as well get a head start

### three albums

[this month's playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5bnrauVHzvTo9t7nupBsam?si=76cd9f7f4fba464c) mostly contains my favourite albums of the month and a couple of less exciting ones that i wanted to give a proper listen

### 3. songs from a world apart - lévon minassian

i've been reading through dune and the instrument and vocal choice of this album seem to fit the vibe perfectly. this is potentially due to cowriter armand amar's moroccan upbringing providing a fresh angle to lévon's normal feel. the whole album has a bit of a narrative feel, which makes it a delight to listen to in the background

### 2. sawtooth - jonny l

i won't lie, i found jonny l through a 'liquid jungle' spotify playlist, but it appears theres good reason for him to be basically at the top of the list. sawtooth is extremely heavy on the electronic instruments, which i adore.

### 1. wants a diamond pivot bright - m. sage

Sage</a></iframe>  
the last album in particular got a huge amount of playtime from me - it's a much more quiet and dainty ambient piece, with a lot of experimentation and new angles from the different featured artists. it features a bunch of different field and life recordings, which made it great to recentre myself during the month

### tanaka tatsuyuki

i found [this artist](https://www.catsuka.com/focuson/tanaka_tatsuyuki/7) while digging around pinterest - he's done a bunch of japanese animation and manga and his style is absolutely _gorgeous_:

i believe the majority of the stuff on his catsuka page is digital, but it does once again make me interested in trekking down the watercolour train. maybe doing it digitally would minimise the amount of mess at the end. in any case, the grimy dieselpunk look is awesome and i think he could be a huge inspiration

### youtube animation

as a christmas gift, i present you with a shitload of different youtube animations - each of these brought something unique that i really enjoyed:

i loved the full-send nature of this piece - the live action recordings really tied the whole thing together and made it super believable. props to the actors, they did an amazing job

the high-shadow rendering style in this animation is supere appealing and worth a go in the near future

the experessions in this one are top notch

this one was just cute and funny :-) very inventive use of the original song

### game award reveals

there were a couple of things that caught my eye during the game awards, but this one caught my eye in particular:

it just feels so damn pure and sweet and looks like loads of fun for you and a bunch of buddies to explore together
