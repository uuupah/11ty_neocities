### agony26
i got an entirely unprompted email from [clover](https://stringlapse.com/blog/2025-08-16-agony26.html) about their spin on [my already very stupid keyboard](https://github.com/uuupah/pain27_kb). the pure unadulterated joy i received from this moment is pretty hard to top honestly. a lot of people who have remixed the board have gone and "fixed" it, which is diametrically opposed to the point, but clover has the joke on lock. you're no doubt reading this, so thank you again for this incredible project, you made my entire week!
