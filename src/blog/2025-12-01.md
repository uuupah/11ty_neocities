## dig it - down to the bone

## zims
when the uk announced that they would be restricting access to wikipedia for minors, i immediately hopped online to figure out how to back up websites for local viewing. the zim storage technology, paired with a software package called kiwix lets youdo exactly this! a lot of sites are pre-packaged to be far smaller (wikipedia is under 10gb, for example) but there are also tools to make your own packages. i grabbed the excellent [android arts](https://androidarts.com) because the site tends to go down every couple of months, but any similarly static site (like someones neocities page, perhaps?) can be backed up equally easily. i want to set up some automated system to update a site on a semi-regular basis, but i'd have to figure out how to simultaneously be considerate of small sites bandwidth limits

## niri
i'd heard whisperings about niri among the linux circles for ages now, but i'd held off on touching it because it's very easy to get caught in the trap of chasing whatever new thing is on hacker news and end up customising your computer more than you actually use it. this was until i learned that niri uses a gnome-style workspace system (one of my biggest complaints with hyprland, as it makes working with multiple screens an absolute nightmare) - i finally caved and gave it a swing and caved fucking immediately. it's so much easier to use than standard tiling window managers, like, it's no contest. i had to use my laptop for serious work briefly an'd jumped back into something more familiar while i was setting the system up, but it took less than 48 hours to fully switch over and i havent looked back since. scrolling window managers fix the neverending window shuffling required by their tiling counterparts. i feel like navigating is more natural, as you spend the bulk of your time moving the viewport instead of moving windows. i've actually left animations on, (they're really helpful for placing myself in the virtual space) and ive found the configuration pretty straightforward. it is definitely missing a couple of visual features - i'm missing being able to dim unfocused windows - but functionality speaking its almost completely there

## electro update
i did it! i put my electro on hold this month. i'd actually been getting a bit worried that my skin was scarring where the electro was being performed, so i'm going to give it a break and see if it chills out. if not, i might just do laser on my face every month for the rest of my life. i guess

## macbook
another programmer friend just bought a new macbook air and sold me their m2 macbook pro for a comfortable discount! i didn't have a specific interest in trying macos but with the opportunity thrust upon me it made sense to see what all the fuss is about on the other considerate

### the good
i've been trying to move away from microsoft and google more given their recent obsession with ai, data collection and forcing new products on you that you're not interested in using. 

## vxe r1 dragonfly
my glorious mouse [i bought back in june](/blog/2025-06-24#doodads) kept giving me the shits, and while [/r/mousereview](https://reddit.com/r/mousereview) is one of the least helpful subreddits ive ever visited for reviewing mice or giving people and degree of help in mouse selection, a bit of digging led me to the r1 dragonfly, a mouse that goes for about fifty bucks from aliexpress and is honestly one of the best ive used in my life. the software runs through a chrome browser, which means you don't have to install it ever, and the settings are all saved to the device. it's going to be my recommended mouse from here out and 

## xteink x4
my other new doodad is this little e-reader. it's extremely pocketable which i've found super handy for reading on the train or just during a quiet moment where i would normally reach for my phone. it's also really cheap, about 80aud, with a nice feeling build quality and decent screen (i say, as someone with no experience with other e-readers). it has some quirks, including having to flash an english firmware using esptool and loading fonts as binary files, but for the price and the size i'm really not too fussed
