every now and then i'll be halfway through one of these and go "damn, this blog feels like a little bit of a shrine to consumerism" (or maybe more consoomerism). talking about media is kind of odd because in person, if i havent experienced what something is but my friends think i should check it out myself, i just want to know 1. is it good and 2. are there any content warnings for it (is it scary or gorey or does it cover some really heavy topics). i'll then check it out; if i like it i'll finish it, if i don't i will generally give up on it, unless its a movie. the really fun media analysis part then comes when you sit down for a cup of tea or wine or something and talk about it with your friend and other people who have seen it. the actual conversation part of it i think is where the value lies (as well as the piece of media itself, or course). talking about stuff in this kind of non-conversational manner is super different to that and honestly just feels self indulgent sometimes, which i suppose it is. it is frankly really fun to just put my thoughts down and construct a page that i think looks cool to read through and reflects my personality in a strange way. i should also give myself a break because theres really only so many ways to talk while blogging. i like general journalling stuff but i do strive to keep myself pretty anonymous here, and besides that i think sharing art and projects are some of the only other big ways to get yourself out there. i could put up musings on world events or financial advice but i dont want to do that, and i also think that kind of falls under the other categories.

i'm not really going anywhere with this i suppose! maybe im just trying to work through how i kind of feel like a dork blogging like this. in any case, i wanted to make a big post of some of the stuff i really liked this year. i feel like the spotify wrapped is kind of soulless and also not particularly helpful because i barely use spotify anymore, and then i was like huh, i guess i should talk about some other things that i've really liked
