title: "on organisation"
draft: true

i'm the kind of person who feels like theyre always being assaulted by a million thoughts and exposed to a million concepts that i might want to revisit: a cool new art style or technique, a game or album or movie that i want to experience, or a friend i haven't caught up with in the last couple of weeks. this used to cause me a great deal of fomo, or something similar, as these thoughts that feel desperately important fall away was a new task appears. i would then remember that there was _something_ important going on in my head a few hours later, but i would have no idea what that _something_ actually was. i hoe that this is a pretty universal experience, and if it isn't i am extremely envious of the people who can just let thoughts come and go (i did learn to do this while doing mindfulness classes, but i feel that the intention there is a bit different)

so i've recognised that i need to do _something_ about the _something_ that i'm forgetting, but i'm not entirely sure what the _something_ i need to do is. in fact, i've just added to the thoughts bouncing around my head by thinking about the thoughts bouncing around my head. it's sort of like the anxiety snowball effect where you start feeling anxious about how anxious you feel

## the organisation balancing act
from my fiddling around with different systems, i've landed on two key variables that are going to determine how useful an organisation system will be for you: ease of storage vs ease of recall. an ultimate system would be super quick for you to put your thoughts down and let you go back to whatever you were doing (ease of storage), as well as super easy for you to find a specific note or thought the moment you want to bring it back (ease of storage). unfortunately, it seems like the best of both worlds doesn't really exist. for example, a notebook is insanely quick to write in, but it can be a real job to hunt down something from a couple of months ago. on the other hand, i can store an image that uses a shadow technique that i would like to replicate in a set of nested directorys (art-inspiration > technique > shadow), and then pull up a bunch of shadow technique inspirations when i want to practice, but navigating through all those directories is a nuisance. additionally, what if that image also has a pose that i really like, or what if i forget that theres a specific directory for shadow techniques and i make another one somewhere else?

### tagging
the latter issue can be somewhat fixed with tagging systems; theyre much easier to navigate, and they allow you to associate one item with multiple concepts. the real issue is that almost nothing _truly_ supports tagging in a way that i find satisfying. obsidian needs bulky frontmatter, pinterest needs more clicks. tumblr supports it rather smoothly, but racking your brain for everything about the image you might want to recall later sucks, and if i'm on my phone i just want to store it and keep scrolling. you could do it after the fact but are you really going to spend half an hour a day tagging everything after the fact instead of doing something fun? let's not even start on windows' support for tagging. i spent a couple of days trying to work out a script to use image recognition to automatically tag images so that they would be easier to find in local storage, before i was blissfully informed that the clusterfuck that is windows search indexing would basically make that useless

### obsidian 
let's put storing images and bookmarks on hold for a second and just focus on note taking. i've mentioned obsidian a couple of times now. the app boasts a pretty similar interface to a modern ide and it flaunts the honestly quite solid benefit of keeping all of your note taking to local, simply formatted files. if you can effectively keep your files in parity between all of your note taking devices, this sounds like a great system to take advantage of the benefits of digital note taking over physical. digital in particular actually provides a solution to the issue i dismissed at the start of this paragraph, because a text file is a great place to store references to images and websites with descriptive text and links. 

so i had a crack at obsidian for a couple of months. i think the real issue is that it actually has more functionality than the average note-taker needs: the most touted is the ability to make connections between files with tags and links, supplemented by the apps ability to make nifty graph views reminiscent of those maps of the internet:

<img src="/_assets/img/on_organisation/graph.webp/"/>

this is mine! cool right? you can see groups of notes related to music in the top right, videogames in the top left, journals and contacts in the bottom right and general miscellania everywhere else. the real issue is that this system is deeply deeply useless. i have basically never used my links to navigate between files, and the tags are largely unnecessary because i can just remember a word or two that i know is in the title or body of a file and search for it that way

fundamentally, this functionality is designed for researchers and students who have huge complicated webs of concepts and documents that are much harder to keep in (wetware) memory. i've also seen people use them for tracking things like a dnd game, and that looks totally cool. for personal notes, however, i don't recommend it; it's basically the programmer's equivalent of making a bullet journal and spending fifteen minutes on each page writing a title in cursive and ruling each area in multicoloured felt tip pens. 

all this said, as a place to keep simple text notes, especially as a holding area for them to be moved elsewhere, obsidian is great. i still use it for many things, especially note tasks where markdown shines (tracking the progress of a software project and the steps required to recreate it is a big one). its more just an issue that obsidian is sold as a solve-all system where i think there are better options

### bullet journals
i'm actually writing this out of order for dramatic effect. bullet journals were one of the first systems i tried using after the old faithful "just having a small book on you all the time". i think the bullet journal also tries to be a solve-all system, but its underlying system is genius. for those unaware, a bullet journal is just a list of thoughts, with certain dot points depending on the type:

• a dot for a task  
x a cross for a completed task  
< / > / V an arrow for a moved task  
\- a hyphen for a thought  
○ a circle for an event
