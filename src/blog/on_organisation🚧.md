title: "on organisation"

i'm the kind of person who feels like theyre always being assaulted by a million thoughts and exposed to a million concepts that i might want to revisit: a cool new art style or technique, a game or album or movie that i want to experience, or a friend i haven't caught up with in the last couple of weeks. this used to cause me a great deal of fomo, or something similar, as these thoughts that feel desperately important fall away was a new task appears. i would then remember that there was _something_ important going on in my head a few hours later, but i would have no idea what that _something_ actually was. i hoe that this is a pretty universal experience, and if it isn't i am extremely envious of the people who can just let thoughts come and go (i did learn to do this while doing mindfulness classes, but i feel that the intention there is a bit different)

so i've recognised that i need to do _something_ about the _something_ that i'm forgetting, but i'm not entirely sure what the _something_ i need to do is. in fact, i've just added to the thoughts bouncing around my head by thinking about the thoughts bouncing around my head. it's sort of like the anxiety snowball effect where you start feeling anxious about how anxious you feel

## the organisation balancing act
from my fiddling around with different systems, i've landed on two key variables that are going to determine how useful an organisation system will be for you: ease of storage vs ease of recall. an ultimate system would be super quick for you to put your thoughts down and let you go back to whatever you were doing (ease of storage), as well as super easy for you to find a specific note or thought the moment you want to bring it back (ease of storage). unfortunately, it seems like the best of both worlds doesn't really exist. for example, a notebook is insanely quick to write in, but it can be a real job to hunt down something from a couple of months ago. on the other hand, i can store an image that uses a shadow technique that i would like to replicate in a set of nested directorys (art-inspiration > technique > shadow), and then pull up a bunch of shadow technique inspirations when i want to practice, but navigating through all those directories is a nuisance. additionally, what if that image also has a pose that i really like, or what if i forget that theres a specific directory for shadow techniques and i make another one somewhere else?

### tagging
the latter issue can be somewhat fixed with tagging systems; theyre much easier to navigate, and they allow you to associate one item with multiple concepts. the real issue is that almost nothing _truly_ supports tagging in a way that i find satisfying. obsidian needs bulky frontmatter, pinterest needs more clicks. tumblr supports it rather smoothly, but racking your brain for everything about the image you might want to recall later sucks, and if i'm on my phone i just want to store it and keep scrolling
