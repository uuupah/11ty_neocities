## silksong
one of my dear friends is an absolute diehard for hollowknight, and has spent the last couple of years bothering me every time the daintiest of silksong news morsels wandered in front of his face. i, on the other hand, played hollow knight back in 2018, beat it, thought it was pretty fun, and then moved on. i remember being uninterested to push through its extremely difficult post-endgame because the controls felt just a little too finnicky, and i _completely_ ignored godhome because those boss rushes were simply out of my skillset. i also felt that the world didnt have too much impact or depth, and that the animation and design sometimes felt a little amateurish. i'm happy to say i was incorrect about the world, but i stand by my assessment on the animation and design. thankfully, team cherry gave themselves seven years to improve on basically everything hollow knight was, and that level of skill that you get from a lot of practice and extremely fine grained criticism from your incredibly popular game (not to mention a more or less blank cheque to spend all the time you need), results in something truly stellar. the world of silksong is incredibly well realised, and moving back and forth through the areas will allow you to naturally pick up connections between all the parts of the former society of pharloom. the music is great, the visuals are cohesive and polished, and the movement and combat is _incredible_. i would regularly be frustrated by the difficulty of some of the more difficult bosses, but i never felt like i was unequipped - either poor planning or a poor reaction had led to my demise. you can absolutely zip around arenas or, if you're a wuss, you can change up your loadout to rely on weird tools to the point that the game kinda plays itself. the freedom is what's important. anyway, not to belabour the poandint, silksong is amazing, and if a gun were put to my head i would probably say that it's my game of the year
## loco motive
this lovely little point and click adventure served me extremely well on a warm autumn evening, not because it's that short, but because i was so utterly enraptured by it and had to finish it in one sitting. this game seems to take most of what is great about point and clicks, provides more of what works with some excellent humour, and a hint system that meant i never felt the need to look online. it wasnt perfect, but it was pretty and funny and absolutely hooked me
## peak
talking about not perfect, peak is a pretty simple game, but it's one of the first friendslop games that i've actually tried and really got into. i think a lot of its ilk kind of just involve you doing things _around_ friends, but peak multiplayer really requires you to plan and strategise to get your whole group to the top. it will actually beat the shit out of you if you're not careful, which makes winning a game all the sweeter
## animal well
this is yet another game that i mentioned in a previous blogpost, but the point still stands. i wasn't originally convinced by the trailer for this game, but giving it a go really opened my eyes to this mysterious little world and its intriguing puzzles. turns out that i really like puzzle metroidvanias, and also that dunkey knew what he was doing when he helped produce this game
## ghost trick
this took me an entire year to finish because i kept leaving my dsi places and not turning it on, but i officially get why people still reference this game 15 years later. the experience feels pretty similar to something like ace attorney, but i only felt myself stumped once or twice, which makes for a far less embarassing experience. the story is meted out perfectly, and the over-the-top character designs and animations were an absolute gem. i did feel that i needed a break pretty regularly due to the mental requirements to work through the game's puzzles, but i always came back eventually. well worth it! also, buy a nintendo dsi! they're cheap and easy to crack and from there it's straightforward to <LEGALLY ACQUIRE> this title
