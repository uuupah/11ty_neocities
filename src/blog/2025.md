this isn't my first tottomori album, but its my favourite so far. i feel like it evokes such a wonderful feeling of exploration and playfulness, like it's express purpose is to give you weird childhood nostalgia. i love the simple piano chords, electronic bloops, field recordings and wavering flute, but i also just love how much the artist is willing to mess with their instruments. there's loads of variety and yet each track feels like its telling part of the same story. this album is extremely calming and i love it dearly

## pezzi della sera - marco castello

describing this album is kinda difficult - i've got it categorised as jazz-pop, which maybe gets you some of the way to understanding its vibe, but not the full distance. it combines this heartfelt vocalist (marco, i assume), synth and a bass guitar the whole way through, in a way that feels kind of close and cosy, but as a lot of the songs continue they almost "open up", as orchestral elements blast through, making the intimate experience suddenly grand and impressive. i uh, don't speak italian, so i cant speak on the lyrics at all, but his performance is so lovely that i feel like you get a lot of out it regardless

## chicha libre - sonido amazonica

i spoke about this one briefly when i put it in my top 3, so i'll try not to repeat myself too much. as someone who listens to a fair bit of latin american music, this almost feels like a concentrated version of all its qualities - the bouncy beat, extremely synthy melodies, and a layer of artifact that comes from playing music out of a portable guitar speaker. in the process of writing this review i've come to learn that olivier conan, the band's creator, is a french man living in brooklyn, which does make me feel a little weird about the album's over the top, and maybe even charicature style, but a bit more reading seems to indicate that their south american audience likes it so 🤷

## richard galliano - luz negra  
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/2025_07_01/luznegra.jpg" rss-link="https://open.spotify.com/album/2vyPIyEBJH12rtR7dMWxsy" rss-linkname="luz negra by richard galliano" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4R3cuBxmTw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

again, spoke about this one at the start of the year, and this time [in a bit more detail](/blog/2025-06-24). i'll leave it to past me to give the nitty gritty of my feelings, and present me can just say that this album is fun! it's good! 

## animation cel - billiam

huh??? this album never ended up getting a review in 2025? i first grabbed it near the start of the year and have adored its frenetic style, bizarre and referential lyrics, and that damn, fucking synthesiser. i actually saw them live this year and they were amazing!

# games
## silksong
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/2025_10_07/silksong.webp", 500, false %}  
one of my dear friends is an absolute diehard for hollow knight, and has spent the last couple of years bothering me every time the daintiest of silksong news morsels wandered in front of his face. i, on the other hand, played hollow knight back in 2018, beat it, thought it was pretty fun, and then moved on. i remember being uninterested to push through its extremely difficult post-endgame because the controls felt just a little too finnicky, and i _completely_ ignored godhome because those boss rushes were simply out of my skillset. i also felt that the world didnt have too much impact or depth, and that the animation and design sometimes felt a little amateurish. i'm happy to say i was incorrect about the world, but i stand by my assessment on the animation and design. thankfully, team cherry gave themselves seven years to improve on basically everything hollow knight was, and that level of skill that you get from a lot of practice and extremely fine grained criticism from your incredibly popular game (not to mention a more or less blank cheque to spend all the time you need), results in something truly stellar. the world of silksong is incredibly well realised, and moving back and forth through the areas will allow you to naturally pick up connections between all the parts of the former society of pharloom. the music is great, the visuals are cohesive and polished, and the movement and combat is _incredible_. i would regularly be frustrated by the difficulty of some of the more difficult bosses, but i never felt like i was unequipped - either poor planning or a poor reaction had led to my demise. you can absolutely zip around arenas or, if you're a wuss, you can change up your loadout to rely on weird tools to the point that the game kinda plays itself. the freedom is what's important. anyway, not to belabour the poandint, silksong is amazing, and if a gun were put to my head i would probably say that it's my game of the year

## loco motive  
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/2025_08_13/locomotive.webp" %}  
this lovely little point and click adventure served me extremely well on a warm autumn evening, not because it's that short, but because i was so utterly enraptured by it and had to finish it in one sitting. this game seems to take most of what is great about point and clicks, provides more of what works with some excellent humour, and a hint system that meant i never felt the need to look online. its hook is that you play three characters on a murder-on-the-orient-express-type setting, each trying to clear your own name. i've seen some complaints that the logic required to figure out some of the puzzles is a little nonsensical and i could maybe agree, but 

## peak
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/2025/peak.jpg" %}  
peak is a pretty simple game, but it's one of the first friendslop games that i've actually tried and really got into. i think a lot of its ilk kind of just involve you doing things _around_ friends, but peak multiplayer really requires you to plan and strategise to get your whole group to the top. it will actually beat the shit out of you if you're not careful, which makes winning a game all the sweeter

## animal well
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/2025_09_01/animalwell.gif" %}  
this is yet another game that i mentioned in a previous blogpost, but the point still stands. i wasn't originally convinced by the trailer for this game, but giving it a go really opened my eyes to this mysterious little world and its intriguing puzzles. turns out that i really like puzzle metroidvanias, and also that dunkey knew what he was doing when he helped produce this game

## ghost trick
{% blogImage "/_assets/img/2025/ghost-trick-shu-takumi.gif" %}  
this took me an entire year to finish because i kept leaving my dsi places and not turning it on, but i officially get why people still reference this game 15 years later. the experience feels pretty similar to something like ace attorney, but i only felt myself stumped once or twice, which makes for a far less embarassing experience. the story is meted out perfectly, and the over-the-top character designs and animations were an absolute gem. i did feel that i needed a break pretty regularly due to the mental requirements to work through the game's puzzles, but i always came back eventually. well worth it! also, buy a nintendo dsi! they're cheap and easy to crack and from there it's straightforward to \<LEGALLY ACQUIRE\> this title
# films
## tampopo
how had i never seen this before? a japanese comedy western about a ramen shop intercut with insane non-sequiter cutaways? tampopo isn't the deepest drama and it doesn't have the most complicated characters, but it's hilarious all the way from the micro to the macro scale, and it's shot beautifully to boot
