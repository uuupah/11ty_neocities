i've had an interesting couple of weeks, and have been dwelling a lot on the things that i really love in my life at the moment. one of the key elements is that i think i've managed to surround myself with lovely, passionate people, and while that's probably normal for a lot of people, i grew up very introverted and quiet, and have had to really fight to get to where i am today. i consider this shift one of the most important of my 20's and with 30 continuing to loom on the horizon, i'm sort of considering this my Guide To Growing Up (As A High School Graduate Interested In Computers And Not Much Else). some of this shit might seem very self explanatory (and may also expose how autistic i can be with the way i approach friendships and relationships), but i hope it's useful to at least one person. i feel like it would have been useful if 20 year old uuupah had heard it

i moved from the fringe suburbs of my state's capital city to a tiny country town at age ten or so - i've got a whole lot of feelings about the move and how it's affected the person i am today. kids are thankfully quite good at finding common ground, especially in schools where each grade has about ten students - you're kind of forced to be friends with basically everyone, which was honestly a really lovely vibe. nevertheless, i did feel a little isolated from these kids, most of whom had know each other since age 5. i was very religious at this point, which meant that my opinions on relationships were quite different to a lot of my peers, but also at odds with an immense teenager-style fear of missing out. i met my first partner fairly incidentally through a church camp (somewhat ironically, because we both backed away from the church just a couple of years later), and i also stumbled onto my longest-running group of friends through team fortress 2, of all things

high school ended, i had a gap year, and then moved back to the big city to go to university. i lost connection with basically everyone in high school because some stayed back to do agriculture, a bunch got into the general workforce in the city, and the rest sort of evenly distributed themselves across the different disciplines. this was a bit of a blessing in disguise, because it once again forced me to meet new people. university does a bit of a better job at concentrating similar people together, and these new friends were also a lot more varied, many of whom coming from different states or having immigrant families. unfortunately, a lot of these friends also moved quite a way after finishing their degree, and i've lost contact with a fair few of them. 

at this point, four years into university, i had a bit of of a breakdown and lined up computer science as a follow-up degree. my previous area of study was the kind to attract pretty outgoing people, but computer science is classically full of shut-ins. i was flabbergasted at how they tended to seat themselves in a checkerboard pattern in the lecture hall, as if no one knew anyone and they were all fine with that.

this was the first time i'd felt _truly_ alone in my day-to-day life, and i endeavoured to fix it. i would go out of my way to chat with people sitting next to me in tutorials and lectures, and asked to join students in classes i shared between lectures. this had a pretty gnarly failure rate and was also VERY scary, but in this case i think it was because a lot of comp sci students are happy to be alone. in any case, it allowed me to find the people that were keen to meet their peers and not tied up in either a blade-runner-2049-k-style-self-validating-loneliness or an exclusive friendship group. this leads me to my first solid rule of digging yourself out of the neet-hole

1. **be a _little_ annoying**
   or rather, don't be _too_ afraid that you're being annoying. people are more interested in meeting new people than you might think

(across the board these rules are going to be have the condition that you actually self reflect. it is still easy to be too annoying even if you have good intentions. read the room, basically)

some of these people also moved on after i finished computer science, but i still keep in touch with a bunch of them today! 


- quiet kid in uni
- was happy enough to spend time with friends online
- got first taste from meeting people at uni - high school friends were mostly just friends of convenience, but the uni people were all closer to my interests and values
- had to change tact once uni finished
- leaned in to the people i still had contact with
- switch flipped in my head to find new experiences
- despite myself, worked really hard on talking to randoms, remembering names, saying yes and just sucking up the fact that it might be uncomfortable
- took a LONG time but the results have been worth it
- if you feel like you want to do something, be the facilitator. people are more excited to go do things than you might expect, and if theyre not, they might not be the people you want to spend time with
- talk about the things you love, and be interested in exploring the things that other people love
- don't get me wrong, i'm terrified of having to meet new people

1. **follow up**  
   if you meet someone cool, get in touch with them again one or two days later. you'll both remember each other better and you can line up another future meeting without it seeming weird or out of the blue


1. follow up
2. be a yes-man (at least for the first couple of times)
3. find the central hub person
3. be a yes-man for yourself
4. be the facilitator 
5. do one on one time with friends
6. yes-and 

* my friends asked me how i cultivate friendships and i dont know lol
