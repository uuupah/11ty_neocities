howdy reader! i haven't been active on here for a little while, but i've had a million ideas bouncing around my head on things that i want to write. this blog post is going to be a bit of a catch all on what i've done in the last few months on this site, what i've been doing offline, as well as sort of bundling my top three albums for the month

### three albums
i've known that spotify's payment plan makes it basically impossible to make money as an indie musician for years, but they recently [really sunk the boot in](https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-changing-how-pays-artists-stream-thresholds) by adding new stream limits to smaller artists. i'd believe that this move was made in somewhat good faith, as it's target was ai generated noise tracks, but it also attacks field recordings, a genre i happen to really enjoy

my plan from here was twofold. i've switched to tidal, which has a better model that gives more to artists, but is priced almost identically (my tidal family subscription is 2aud more than my spotify couple's plan); i also started hoarding my favourite albums locally. my first port of call was bandcamp, which has [also recently enjoyed a bit of drama](https://www.billboard.com/pro/bandcamp-employees-layoffs-sale-to-songtradr/), but at least guarantees to give the vast majority of money to their artists. a five dollar album isn't very much for me to cough up now that i have a real job, but gives the artist more money than all of my streaming to this point would have paid out

my backup move is the excellent (but less legal) [zspotify](zshttps://github.com/jsavargas/zspotifypotify). zspotify can download an absurd amount of money in a super short amount of time, and doesn't actually require that you use a premium spotify account to use it

with all of this local music handled, i redownloaded foobar2000 and musicbee, two old local music tools i had in my (short) pre-spotify days - foobar provides a more customisable experience, which was why i used it as my primary player for so long, but musicbee honestly surprised me at how nice it has become. it also has really solid auto-tagging provided by musicbrainz, which helps to fix some of the formatting screw ups provided by zspotify

in any case, because of all this back and forthing my october [monthly playlist is looking a little bit gaunt](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Txr3rv2geMLw1XWzxSXCG?si=98ef2e5955954335), but i can still drop in some albums i enjoyed, sans any big cereberal criticism and analysis.

### baldur's gate
- 4p co-op
- non binary experience

### starfield
- hampered by getting stuck in procedural generation hell
  - why even include this when it feels so soulless

### art progress
- back and forth, feeling frustrated
