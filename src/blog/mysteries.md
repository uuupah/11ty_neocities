i was thinking today about how crazy it must of been to look at the world even as recently as a couple hundred years ago. where do diseases come from? how did mountains and valleys form? <FILL> ? we live in a time where just about any question you could have about the world has an answer, as long as you're not looking too small or too big

how much of this did they not even understand that they didn't understand

every now and then i'll have a bit of a moment where i find myself thinking it's almost unfair that i'll probably never know the answer to what happened before the birth of the universe as we know it, or how big the universe is, or whether it even has limits. if it has limits, what sits outside them? if it doesn't have limits, how does that even work? cosmic scale in general has also been an interesting thing to grapple with - its unlikely that i'll ever go to space, despite the speculative "non fiction" books i read as a kid, and even if i do, the insane distances between everything in the universe means that i _definitely_ won't be visiting another planet. idk, is it reasonable 

<!-- i dont think im alone in being kind of fucking spooked by a lot of the mysteries of the universe -->
