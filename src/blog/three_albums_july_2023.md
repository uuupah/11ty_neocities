### 3. cancionero musical de palacio: music of the spanish court - accentus ensemble

i stumbled onto this by complete accident and might have ignored it if it was a bit less interesting, but when someone drops an album based on tunes from the 1500s into your lap, i feel like it's generally worth a listen. i was really taken aback by how much it reminds me of what some might consider stereotypical medieval style music, but i guess it makes total sense to use the real deal as your inspiration when making a movie or videogame or whatever. either that, or the accentus ensemble took some heavy creative liberties when recording this thing

### 2. what a body can do - female wizard

listening to this album sends me straight into the nightclub scene from the matrix, which is ridiculous, because none of the music in the matrix sounds like this. i've heard some people say that this is a more dj-friendly album than their previous, which is probably why i get that impression, but it also makes the sometimes-grating industrial experience almost easy to listen to. despite that, the album has plenty of depth to it, as each track leads you from a nice approachable entry point to something grimier and with loads more depth

### 1. radio therapy part 1 - sci clone

rym assigns the genre "jazzstep" to radio therapy part 1 which is frankly foul. who is making up genre names these days? thankfully it has broken beat and liquid dnb as kinda "sub-genres" which works just fine, because this album is a classic liquid dnb piece in my opinion. the first track opens with a classic start-of-album answering machine message talking about how the caller finds sci-clone exciting and relaxing and says that it "takes them back to all the places that i've been that i love"; i'm not sure how intentional it was, but the positivity coming off of this opening slice immediately rubs off on you and primes you to just have a really pleasant time. the sound is very reminiscent of something you might find in a classic 90's racing game, but it doesn't feel like they're chasing an aesthetic, and rather just feels like the organic feel of a pair of guys that fell into a particular type of music that they like to make

### honourable mention: oneohtrix point never
<img style="max-width: 360px;" src="/_assets/img/three_albums_july_2023/meirl.jpg" title="this is me btw. if you're mean to me this is who you're being mean to :(">  

oneohtrix point never is doing an australian tour and i made it to the local gig! i'm not sure that i've aired my gripes with live electronic music, and this set definitely isn't immune to my normal criticisms, but it was still a really fun experience. the skinny is that many electronic artists make pieces that are too complicated to perform live, but people are there to hear the tracks that they know, so they're forced to either play a cut down version of the classics or to find a way to "perform" them, which normally just means plugging all of the stems into a midi controller and making fine adjustments during the show. my favourite part was the encore, where he went up and performed a live composition on his two synths and decks, although you can sort of see why the full tracks require a little more fuss. in any case, still on the hunt for some artists that are happy to make some toned-down versions of their classics, or to play their classics but with more time between transitions to make up for the manual overhead
