### my three (?) favourite albums of october 2024!

i swear to god im not doubling up on last months cop out, the first three are albums and the last two are singles that i would have felt guilty including as full fledged entries

i might not have much to say about this album because i purely gravitated to this album for the unbridled upbeat positivity. 2024 is really my year for diving into pop music. does that say something about my mental state? (yes)

### mg ultra - machine girl

id had this one on my radar since its announcement, to the degree that i (foolishly) preordered the vinyl. the album is thankfully really good, and runs a great balance between the more electronic feeling of the neon white soundtrack and super freq, and the heavier, more industrial feel of u-void synthesiser and the ugly art. the album works pretty damn well as a complete experience, with my only complaint that motherfather feels a bit jarring and off theme. i was honestly a little surprised that it was picked as one of the prerelease singles but to each their own i suppose

### bewitched - laufey

i was recommended this one by my good pal flynn (hello flynn, you're probably not reading this) who described her as "a really good legitimately talented jazz singer doing vocals for bossa nova that somehow became really popular with straight gen z women". her song "from the start" blew the fuck up on tiktok (and is on this album) and i am not at all cynical about it. this album is so unbelievably lovely and laufey's voice is absolutely enchanting. it kind of makes me think of lana del ray but what if her songs weren't about seeking out relationships with borderline abusive power dynamics. my favourite track is california and me, the sorrowful but very genuine lyrics really hit me in the gut

### m3 n min3 - femtanyl feat. danny brown
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/2024_11_01/menmin.webp" rss-link="https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/m3-n-min3-feat-danny-brown" rss-linkname="m3 n min3 by femtanyl and danny brown on bandcamp" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3338822948/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://femtanyl.bandcamp.com/track/m3-n-min3-feat-danny-brown">M3 n MIN3 feat. Danny Brown by Femtanyl</a></iframe>

how did i not see a femtanyl and danny brown collab happening? danny's voice is a perfect match for femtanyl's musical and lyrical pace and i will probably sit here begging for a full album with the two for the foreseeable future

### six desperate ballads - the garden
<iframe rss-image="/_assets/img/2024_11_01/sixdesperateballads.webp" rss-link="https://open.spotify.com/album/6uyvyAGd5mu5720vL5h7LX" rss-linkname="six desperate ballads by the garden on spotify" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6uyvyAGd5mu5720vL5h7LX?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

i might have talked about my interesting relationship with the garden before - i like quite a lot of their music, but they have a bad habit of sticking meme songs in their albums, making them hard to listen to all the way through. six desperate ballads fixes this by squishing the experience down to ten minutes and showcasing pure the garden vibes, doing the styles they do best. i actually had a friend ask me what song spoke to me the most and i had to think about it for a serious amount of time because i think the whole experience is so solid, it's almost like it's one really long really sick track that i couldnt imagine splitting up

### im begging you make this eggplant parm

holy shit i mostly hate eggplant for its tendency to turn into unappealing mush but this is truly one of the best things ive made all year i swear you need to try it. my only modification would be to peel the skins completely, theres just no way to make them texturally edible, and also cut them into rounds instead of slices - the rounds are way more tender

although in my defence my ex tends to follow up any really nice catch ups with a bit of a gut punch of news from their end. i did sign up for a psychologist though! no reason

### ⚠ watch this space ⚠

i have this huge list of other stuff i want to talk about but i might move it to another blogpost just so this one doesnt come out too late
