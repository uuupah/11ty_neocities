### hello!
the weather's been getting colder, and my sense of smell is getting worse - partly because of the temperature, partly because the plants arent as fragrant, and partly because of the onset of my annual six-month perma-cold. i blissfully missed a huge chunk of australia's hideous summer this year, but i did get a lot of value out of impromptu late night beach trips and i'll definitely miss them. my partner and i hopped into the ocean on the night of the last 28 degree day of the season, trying to fool ourselves that the now frigid water would be pleasantly cool instead of painfully teeth-chatteringly cold

still! i love the cold. i enjoy layering up my clothes and light rain, and braving full on thunderstorms under a ten dollar ikea umbrella. i'm excited to head out of the city and go on some drizzly hikes over running streams and hopefully not slip on rocks and crack my head open

the month has been lovely! i went to multiple gallery openings, multiple poetry nights, a live irish punk gig at a garage sale, bought a load of cute ceramics and made a linocut bookplate (i really want to share this because i'm super proud of the final result, but it also has my legal name on it). i'm helping to plan a yule / winter solstice party (the scope of which is getting rapidly out of hand) and making a bunch of posters / images for social media posts. despite all this, it's felt like a pretty quiet month

my music exploration has been both really good and pretty hard to document this april. i've found musicbee's autodj feature allows you to queue up whole albums instead of individual songs, so i've been letting it step through my collection and plan albums that i sometimes haven't listened to in years. it's been awesome! but it's made picking out individual albums as discoveries of the month somewhat difficult

i've been thinking of talking about food a lot more recently! i've been cooking some interesting stuff with my partner and it's got me A. experimenting with and developing recipes and B. wanting a good record of all the recipes that i think are good. i've found keeping lists of references on my blog actually super useful - something about having it super easily accessible through any browser i suppose? i'm thinking of putting recipes that i've stolen or ones that i've modified in their own subsection, similar to the misc posts i currently have, and maybe funnel them into a big masterpost somewhere. i think my initial trepidation on doing something like this was being afraid of being a "food blogger" but like, it's my blog. i get to figure out what it looks like. so i just wont make it like the food blogs that i hate?
