### hello!
the weather's been getting colder, and my sense of smell is getting worse - partly because of the temperature, partly because the plants arent as fragrant, and partly because of the onset of my annual six-month perma-cold. i blissfully missed a huge chunk of australia's hideous summer this year, but i did get a lot of value out of impromptu late night beach trips and i'll definitely miss them. my partner and i hopped into the ocean on the night of the last 28 degree day of the season, trying to fool ourselves that the now frigid water would be pleasantly cool instead of painfully teeth-chatteringly cold. the latter was unfortunately the case. 

still! i love the cold. i enjoy layering up my clothes and light drizzles, and braving full on thunderstorms under the weirdly powerful autonomy of a ten dollar ikea umbrella. i'm excited to head out of the city and go on some drizzly hikes over running streams and hopefully not slipping on rocks and cracking my head open
