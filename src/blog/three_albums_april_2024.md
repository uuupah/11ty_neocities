i've had a hell of a couple of months that have somewhat impacted my blogging and art schedules, but i have to get in the three albums for april 2024 for the sake of my own sanity. theres a couple more things in the pipeline, so keep an eye on the blog!

i had a friend throw this on at a little friendly get-together and i was honestly stunned at how incredible they were and the fact that i'd never seen them before. this performance in particular is a very synthy acid jazz performance with some lovely vocals that meld harmoniously into the instrumentation - the guitars remind me of casiopea, the vocals of pinc louds and the synths are really poppy, almost like galen tipton or something from the mother 3 soundtrack. the whole set is a bit of a journey and pretty masterfully merges a _fairly_ conventional jazz flow with searching ambient segments and haunting vocal solos.  

### i am - wilding

after absolutely stacking my monthly playlist with weird ambient music and synthwave nonsense i stumbled onto this track on my local community radio and it very quickly rose to the top of the ranks for this month. i normally don't care for lyrics with meaning but this track manages to weave meaning into something still whimsical and a little silly. the melody itself is a piece of extremely upbeat and lighthearted british-flavoured indie pop, despite the artist being australian. the whole thing is exquisitely catchy and was stuck in my head for days (in a good way)

### hard to make plans - naomi keyte

when i said i don't care for lyrics in the last paragraph, i was slightly lying. i was lucky enough to have this track played live for me at a yoga meditation and the lyrics hit me like an absolute truck. i've been feeling very scared and uncertain recently, and i think feeling like someone else was feeling the same way helped to soothe my soul (but not before causing a pretty intense outpouring of emotion). i think the vocalist has absolutely beautiful vocal technique and the production of the whole technique is so blissfully genuine - this song has been a bit of a life preserver for me for the last week or so (so if you're reading this naomi, thank you so much!)
