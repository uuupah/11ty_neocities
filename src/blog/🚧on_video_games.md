i'm a terrible media finisher - i think a lot of people are. i _do_ take it to an extreme that a lot of people don't by tracking everything ive ever started or finished - i think others have better things to think about, and less attachment to pointless completion. that's probably where I start with videogames, like a lot of people. my parents were broke, i was perpetually a generation behind, and the games i did get got absolutely completely completed.
