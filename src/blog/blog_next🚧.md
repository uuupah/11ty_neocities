### some things i've been thinking about lately

#### my art and this blog
i've only been ""doing"" ""art"" for the last two-ish years, and i decided early in to focus on my own satisfaction and learning over chasing social media numbers. i have shared my work semi-privately in small artist communities (discord servers mostly) and i do recommend doing that if you're starting out to get feedback and motivation. this said, i've avoided an instagram or a twitter for showcasing my stuff, just because i don't want to be one of those artists that is forced to vertical videos of sketch timelapses with that "did you know how much it means to us artists if you share our work" audio over the top (i do 100% understand why people do this and don't really judge them though; if you want to make a career out of art it really seems that shit like this is the only viable option. i also super love watching peoples progress in timelapse for my own learning).

all this said, i think this blog might make for an excellent place to share my stuff, given that it doesn't have the social media stench attached to it. the real stinker is finding a good portfolio layout and maybe pulling in a lightbox plugin, but i'd be happy to throw some of my stuff up here. maybe when i get good enough i'll make a dedicated instagram.

i'll probably make a masterpage or a regular post with artists that i'm jiving with. my current little taste test is peter6409, who has that very artstation object concept artist vibe that i really like:
<a href="https://peter6409.artstation.com/">peter6409.artstation.com/</a> // <a href="https://twitter.com/peter6409">twitter.com/peter6409</a>

i'll probably talk about how i manage inspirations and references across the internet (spoiler: it's messy). i'm currently having to reorganise about a hundred tabs that i left open on my laptop from twitter and tumblr posts that i want to use; hopefully this can improve.

i'm heavily of the opinion that audiophiles are deranged and could spend their money elsewhere, but i do recognise the benefit of some of the more entry level audio gear: more power to run higher impedence headphones or unpowered amps, support for balanced (if that's your thing), lower noise floor, a nice big dial on the front for when a game decides to run at 0 db and blow your eardrums out.

i've had a couple of desktop dacs and amps since i started taking pc stuff seriously: the infamous [schiit](https://www.schiit.com/products/magni-plus) [stack](https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-plus), and some nice jds labs gear [(dac)](https://jdslabs.com/product/ol-dac/), [(amp)](https://jdslabs.com/product/atom-amp/). i've had complaints about both of these setups, namely that australian import prices are absurd, the wall warts to use them are cumbersome, and a mysterious failure in my modi.
