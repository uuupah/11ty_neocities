### more stuff that i've been thinking about

#### series of photos of oil rigs

if you dont think about the environmental impact these are so fucking cool. oil rigs have this particular hyper industrial look to them that you dont get in many other places and would make for an excellent inspiration for other industrial drawings. it's like hyperconcentrated cyberpunk vibes.  

#### organisation postmortem
i mentioned my bullet journalling technique in my post [on organisation](/blog/on_organisation) and how i sort of skip the larger scale life planning, instead keeping them in google calendar and records of past events in my journal. i do wonder if i should try bullet journalling properly because A. it would allow me to keep more of my thoughts in one place where i can bounce them off each other and B. it would force me to keep my bullet journal at hand more often instead of leaving it in the other room accidentally. dropping google calendar does have the downsides of taking info off the cloud (chance of data loss if i misplace the book) and a lack of noisy notifications to tell me when an event is happening.

a friend of mine also started using evernote and likes it a lot, which makes me wonder if i should get in on it as well. i do know that i dont like taking short term notes on a phone because theres more fuss involved than just scribbling something down, but there might be some benefits i havent experienced before

i also stumbled onto the concept of a commonplace book which seems interesting, but the concept seems a little hard to nail down. i think it might actually just be "a book you put your thoughts and notes in" which i actually already have via my second field notes: this one contains my journals in the back, but also movie notes, shopping lists, recipes, napkin maths etc.

<sup>these are my notes from my recent playthrough of fez, where i foolishly tried to translate the in game language before the part where the game just tells you. i cherish how it looks like absolute crazy person scrawlings</sup>


finally, i've started using grouvee to track my games, which hopefully should mean i can stop using my weird obsidian system for it. my obsidian needs a downsize in general and this would help a lot in keeping it exclusively to the things that benefit the most from being saved on a simple markdown editor. the two other big ones are music ranking and my rolodex; the former could maybe be done by creating the worlds most simple rym account, and the latter by migrating all of my personal notes to google contacts or some other service? maybe?

#### camping
i went camping a couple weeks ago for the first time in forever and it has cemented my feeling of "i don't really get camping unless you are specifically going out to do something (like climbing, fishing, bird watching etc). camping is fun for a day, especially as a way to reset yourself with nature and chat with your pals for a bit, but i feel like i dont have enough interesting things to talk about for more than a day at most.
