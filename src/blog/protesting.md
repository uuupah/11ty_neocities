title: protesting

- some protesting is good - australia day, protested for a local pub
- some protesting seems less useful - ukraine, american abortion laws
  - literally virtue signalling
- the only problem is that not protesting and not making it known that a slice of our population disagree and don't feel represented is important
- i havent gone full liberal after getting money, but i do still have a fear of it impacting my corporate job
  - this also impacts my friends who work in lower paying jobs but are interested in one day working in politics
