title: "the uuupah playlist project"
date: 2025-06-05
---

i have about ten thousand albums in my personal collection and despite my best efforts it continues to grow. this makes the massive volume of music, heavily weighted towards more ambient genres, super hard to categorise into playlists, especially because i am a chronic Album Listener. hence, in 2025 i have committed to at least beginning to take a bite out of this particular problem by grouping the albums into playlists by general style. these styles are heavily arbitrary and based on the particular energy i'm looking for when listening to a specific album. also keep in mind that i use the term "ambient" _very_ liberally, but in my defence, so does the music community. i use ambient to generally mean "low energy enough that i can listen to it while working without any change to my heartrate"

i'm storing this in text format because it makes it much more resistant to particular companies perhaps going completely under because their business strategy is incompatibility with the material truths of reality (see: spotify) and also allows for me to set it up on my miriad different systems at my own pace

current as of the fifth of june 2025. this is a work in progress! albums are likely to appear, disappear and move around

how it feels to painstakingly rebuild these playlists and listen to them yourself:

### light industrial ambient
these albums have a crunchy, mechanical feeling to them, without falling into something more heavy a-la industrial techno
- [polar sequences - the higher intelligence agency and biosphere](https://higherintelligenceagency.bandcamp.com/album/polar-sequences)
- [no highs - tim hecker](https://timhecker.bandcamp.com/album/no-highs)
- [la barca - thomas k√∂ner](https://thomaskoner.bandcamp.com/album/la-barca-complete-edition)

### arctic ambient (drone)
the line between this and space ambient is subtle, but clear, at least to me. this should give you the vibe of climbing through an ice cave or walking along a frigid beach. my grasp of the concept is very inspired by the jeremy soule tracks that play on the north coast of skyrim
- [deep frieze - sleep research facility](https://coldspring.bandcamp.com/album/deep-frieze-csr72cd)
- [sargo / posidonia - sleep research facility & llyn y cwn](https://coldspring.bandcamp.com/album/sargo-posidonia-csr317lp)
- permafrost - thomas k√∂ner
- [nuuk - thomas k√∂ner](https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/nuuk)
- nunatak - thomas k√∂ner
- novaya zemlya - thomas k√∂ner
- teimo - thomas k√∂ner
- [aubrite - thomas k√∂ner](https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/aubrite)
- [coast/range/arc - loscii](https://loscil.bandcamp.com/album/coast-range-arc)
- the labyrinth: official soundtrack - simon stalenhag

### space ambient
my mental image for space ambient is floating through the inky void, completely detached from my life support and quickly on my way to an early and lonely demise. alternatively, that feeling you get behind your shoulder blades when you zoom right into a black hole in Stellaris
- [slowly drown in static - tineidae](https://tineidae.bandcamp.com/album/slowly-drown-in-static)
- [mirages - tim hecker](https://timhecker.bandcamp.com/album/mirages)
- [pop - gas](https://kompakt-gas.bandcamp.com/album/pop) (requires some trimming)
- [narkopop - gas](https://kompakt-gas.bandcamp.com/album/narkopop)
- [the entire obsidian soundfields discography](https://www.youtube.com/@OBSIDIANSOUNDFIELDS)

### ethereal ambient
these all give a beautiful sunnny floaty vibe - where the last two were a bit somber and spooky, this playlist feels a little bit sunny and down to earth
- [self destruction themes - wordclock](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/self-destruction-themes)
- [brilliance - suzanne doucet and william wichman](https://suzannedoucet.bandcamp.com/album/suzanne-doucet-william-wichmann-brilliance)
- [the elderwood guardian - witch bolt](https://witchbolt1.bandcamp.com/album/the-elderwood-guardian)
- [languoria - sofie birch and antonina nowa](https://mondoj.bandcamp.com/album/languoria)
- [full/new - lightbath and emily a. sprague](https://rvng.bandcamp.com/album/full-new)
- [nocturne chalice - dream crease](https://dreamcrease.bandcamp.com/album/nocturne-chalice)
- [gold fiction loop garden - imaginary softwoods](https://imaginarysoftwoods.bandcamp.com/album/gold-fiction-loop-garden)
- [springhill - the green kingdom](https://thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com/album/springhill)
- [kofu ii - meitel](https://meitei.bandcamp.com/album/kofu-ii-ii) (requires some trimming)
- when worlds collide without echo - desolate horizons
- a moment with no end pt. iv - stellar remnants
- until we meet the sky - solar fields
- extended - solar fields

### cyber ambient
these all feel like the ambient music of a cyberpunk world (not the _regular_ music of a cyberpunk world)
- [motus - thomas koner](https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/motus) (this one is very droney - kinda feels like hearing club music from another room)
- [mothership - tineidae](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/mothership)
- [exo - tineidae](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/exo)
- [era3.ii - dreamstate logic](https://dreamstatelogic.bandcamp.com/album/era3-ii)
- konigsforst - GAS
- 76:14 - global communication
- hanging masses - cell
- leaving home - solar fields
- control soundtrack - petri alanko

### field ambient
these are not necessarily field recordings, but rather albums that feel really tactile and real - although field recordings help. this category just needs a better name overall
- [skal_ghost - arovane and taylor deupree](https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/skal-ghost)
- [captiva - stephen vitiello and taylor deupree](https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/captiva)
- [six songs for invisible gardens - green-house](https://green-house.bandcamp.com/album/six-songs-for-invisible-gardens)
- [komachi - meitei](https://metronrecords.bandcamp.com/album/komachi)
- [music for tomato plants - loris s. sarid](https://ctatsu.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-tomato-plants)
- [languoria - sofie birch](https://mondoj.bandcamp.com/album/languoria)
- repair techniques - sophie birch
- captiva - taylor deupree
- twine - taylor deupree
- listening garden - taylor deupree
- komachi - meitel
- offworld field guide - the green kingdom (this one might play double duty in melodic ambient as well)

### somber ambient
these are the albums that you can just lie on the floor and zone out completely to. there shouldn't be anything in here that's _properly_ somber because that bums me out and i don't want to listen to it
- springhill - the green kingdom 
- februarys - taylor deupree
- for the summer, or forever - halftribe
- passive aggressive - suzanne kraft and jonny nash
- in a place of such graceful shapes - taylor deupree
- somi - taylor deupree
- invisible architecture #8 - taylor deupree
- ambient 1 : music for airports - brian eno
- music for installations - brian eno
- prismatic - the green kingdom

### melodic ambient
these are the albums riding the line between classical and ambient music. i like them a lot!
- postcards - the kyoto connection
- voyager - the green kingdom (trim some tracks)
- the north wind and the sun - the green kingdom (this honestly isnt really even that ambient)
- reflecting light vol 1. - suzanne doucet
- the north water - tim hecker
- twig and twine - the green kingdom
- ambient 2 - harold budd/brian eno
- holo - kiln

### i can't believe it's not skyrim
these are albums that are all not skyrim, except the one that is
- isverdin: spirits - askii
- isverdin: rituals - askii (i sometimes am not in the mood for this album, it doesnt blend in with the rest of them perfectly)
