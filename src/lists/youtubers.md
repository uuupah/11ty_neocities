this is an extremely indulgent move but dalub provides the most wonderfully genuine splatoon montages with just a bunch of people messing about, where everything else on youtube is tryign far too hard to put out regular weekly content instead of just having fun

hhhazel is an anime video creator who goes to stupid lengths to communicate her feelings in a way that allows you to really empathise with her, as well as understand some of the (more) objective qualities about a show or series that set it apart from the rest. i always feel like i'm getting better at art criticism and analysis whenever i listen to her

whitestone jazz is a mathematician who splits time between describing mathematical concepts in minecraft and breaking down the maths / logic of cool minecraft systems for the layperson. it's still pretty in-depth stuff, but i think he does a good job of simplifying it

jenny nicholson fits squarely in the camp of people who are delightful to listen to because they're simply extremely passionate. her videos span a bunch of different topics but there is a lot of movie and tv stuff, with some absolute out-there left-field type topics in between
