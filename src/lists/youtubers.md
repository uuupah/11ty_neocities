    "benn jordan is The Flashbulb, a musical artist i enjoy immensely, but his youtube channel is also a goldmine of super interesting music tidbits, as well as (unexpectedly) a really cool citizen scientist? the stuff he makes is super varied and always extremely well thought out and presented and i always watch his new videos the second they come out"

    "i don't want to diminish josh's skill in any amount by calling his youtube series an entertainment-first cooking show, but the fact of the matter is that it is extremely entertaining. his cute callback bits are somehow always funny, his positive outlook is infectious, and you feel it when he messes us just as bad as he does. i could (and do) accidentally watch fifteen episodes in a row while doing my own cooking"

    "masaru probably isn't for everyone because his whole deal is that he catches and fillets fish, but if you don't have an issue with seeing that kind of thing i think he's an extremely interesting person. masaru has an incredible devil-may-care personality which is hyperfocused into trying to catch and eat every aquatic animal under the sun. he's quite knowledgeable about fish and filleting them, but he also has a genuine explorative innocence that makes him a joy to watch"
