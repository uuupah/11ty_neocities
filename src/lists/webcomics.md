### prequel
[read here](https://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/)

one of many homestuck-likes that appeared in the 2010s. this one is based on this misadventures of a khajiit in the land of cyrodiil (these are all elder scrolls things for those unaware, but you don't need to be familiar with the games to enjoy the comic). the updates are slow and indeed, we thought the comic was dead for a while, but it's been getting semi-regular updates for the last year or so.

### bug quest
[read here](https://bug-quest.tumblr.com/post/103002341490)

another homestuck-like, this time with anthropomorphic bugs. couple of hateful comments ended up acknowledged by the comic, unfortunately, but otherwise it's a cute little experience.

(also i am aware that the user-comment-driven comic was not invented by homestuck, but these two comics were very clearly inspired by that seminal work). talking about homestuck:

### homestuck & problem sleuth & sweet bro and hella jeff
[read here](https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/index.html)

the assorted works of internet crazy person andrew hussie are varied, and have also not really stood the test of time (especially with the death of flash). while there is some 2000's style questionable subject matter lightly sprinkled in amongst them, and homestuck went slightly off the rails when it comes to writing a grand metaphor about the reader / writer interaction, they are absolute classics that i still believe are worth reading. homestuck is a real big one, so i would recommend going through them in the order of sweet bro -> problem sleuth -> homestuck. problem sleuth in particular is very tightly written and wraps up quite neatly, so if you get through that and then had to stop during homestuck i won't blame you.

### what happens next
[read here ❗content warning for murder and the gamut of queer issues❗](https://whathappensnext.webcomic.ws/archive/)

a really wild comic about trans people in the real world and tumblr / true crime culture. deals with some really heavy stuff so read the content warning for each sub-story.
