### ichiban delicious tonkotsu ramen with real pok
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/noodles/ichibantonkotsu.webp', 500, true %}

these noodles are absolutely whacky. i bought them in paper bowls (accidentally) but that does mean the portions are pretty good. they come with an oil, a dry flavour powder and a sauce, which contains real fucking pieces of real pork that came from a real pig that once walked this earth. i assume the manner they used to preserve it at room tempterature works because i did not get sick. while i am very pro-pieces of actual meat in my noodles, there was something a little uncanny about this pork, as well as a slightly strange flavour; not unpleasant, just strange. this, combined with the really thing flat noodles that i don't desperately care for, means that i dont super recommend these, but they might be up your alley

### neoguri seafood & mild
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/noodles/neoguriseafoodandmild.webp', 360, true %}

awesome big chunky noodles, 2 minute cook in boiling water. the neoguri naruto are cute, and the other fillings are just seaweed and scallion and little bit of carrot. overall a little underwhelming on this front, add your own egg and scallions. the broth is surprisingly mushroomy while the seafood flavour is a bit harder to find

### samyan ramen
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/noodles/samyangramenmild.webp', 500, true %}

standard thinner noodles in a square brick. a really distinct smokey essence which was interesting, but nothing else that really stands out flavour-wise. the noodles cook in 1.5 minutes in the microwave. toppings are some distinctly sand spring onions and distinctly less sad little meat bits. the spice level teeters on my limit for comfort but is still totally fine
