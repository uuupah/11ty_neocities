### neoguri seafood & mild
{% blogImage '/_assets/img/noodles/neoguriseafoodandmild.webp', 360, true %}

awesome big chunky noodles, 2 minute cook in boiling water. the neoguri naruto are cute, and the other fillings are just seaweed and scallion and little bit of carrot. overall a little underwhelming on this front, add your own egg and scallions. the broth is surprisingly mushroomy while the seafood flavour is a bit harder to find

### samyan ramen

standard thinner noodles in a square brick. a really distinct smokey essence which was interesting, but nothing else that really stands out flavour-wise. the noodles cook in 1.5 minutes in the microwave. toppings are some distinctly sand spring onions and distinctly less sad little meat bits. the spice level teeters on my limit for comfort but is still totally fine
