## 🤸 technique
\- **[the drawing database](https://www.youtube.com/@thedrawingdatabase8743)** northern kentucky university art lectures  
\- **fuck drawabox** i know it has its place but i do not like it as a tool for new artists i think it totally puts you in the wrong headspace. learn to make stuff you like and then do about half of drawabox to tighten some fundamentals

## 📐 design
\- **[lospec palettes](https://lospec.com/palette-list)** this site is designed for pixel art but the palettes available on here are super useful for other art
\- **[llesa poc features](https://twitter.com/Lle_plus_a/status/1739399709666553922)** some tips for drawing poc characters

## 📷 reference
\- **[grafit studio](https://grafitschool.gumroad.com/)** these refs aren't free but theyre pretty cheap, and very high quality  
\- **[the pose archive](https://www.deviantart.com/theposearchives)** this couple do the same poses with both a masc and fem body which is super convenient for learning, and their backlog is gigantic

### clothing
\- **[nationalclothing.org](https://nationalclothing.org/)** this and the below link are designed for finding good references of national cultural clothing  
\- **[claire hummel's historical fashion reference](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1R8eulTsb9Zlc7h2H917dNJZS9s0rIq9OAu7LpSS9F2k/mobilebasic?pli=1)**  

## 🛠️ tools
\- **[marc brunet brushes](https://cubebrush.co/mb/products/m2ri4q/starter-brush-pack-2023)** some really cute free brushes
