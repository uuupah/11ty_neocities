(i stole this structure from friend of the site yamasztuka ty <3)

## technique
**[the drawing database](https://www.youtube.com/@thedrawingdatabase8743)**  
northern kentucky university art lectures

**fuck drawabox**  
i know it has its place but i do not like it as a tool for new artists i think it totally puts you in the wrong headspace. learn to make stuff you like and then do about half of drawabox to tighten some fundamentals

## design
**[lospec palettes](https://lospec.com/palette-list)**  
this site is designed for pixel art but the palettes available on here are super useful for other art

## reference
**[grafit studio](https://grafitschool.gumroad.com/)**  
these refs aren't free but theyre pretty cheap, and very high quality

**[the pose archive](https://www.deviantart.com/theposearchives)**  
this couple do the same poses with both a masc and fem body which is super convenient for learning, and their backlog is gigantic

## tools
**[marc brunet brushes](https://cubebrush.co/mb/products/m2ri4q/starter-brush-pack-2023)**  
some really cute free brushes
