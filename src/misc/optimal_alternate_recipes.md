this guide is absolutely stellar for planning out your satisfactory factory, but with reddit getting flakier by the day i'm going to back it up here. credit to wrigh516, original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/mpjzfb/optimal_alternate_recipes_pushing_the_raw/)

##### Maximum Output Potential Production Map

A few days ago, I posted a [alternate recipe ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/mnwugx/update_4_alternate_recipe_indepth_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for making the game easier using a mathematical model I created. There were some commenters that didn't like seeing some recipes ranked below others. My reasoning was that there are some major trade-offs, and the post's goal was to choose recipes that make the game easier. **I said I would provide another ranking for maximizing the raw resources.**

First, let's all get on the same page. I'm assuming that you want to build the last tier space elevator parts in the 4-4-1-1 ratio needed to get the "Employee of the Planet" coffee cup and then maximize space elevator parts from there on. Keep in mind, there is a way to maximize Awesome sink points with a single product (Assembly Director System). See my past ranking link above to learn more about that.

Here is what you can get:
- 124.56 Assembly Director Systems  
- 124.56 Magnetic Field Generators  
- 31.14 Thermal Propulsion Rockets  
- 31.14 Nuclear Pastas  

Complete the last tier in 32.11 minutes or get 105,715,131 points/min in the Awesome Shop.

This will only have 2 tiers:

#### Required Alternate Recipes

These are recipes that you MUST have to get the maximum number of items per minute.

#### Optional Alternate Recipes

These are recipes that will reduce the raw resources used and maintain the maximum number of items per minute.

#### Using only Required Recipes

[Here it is on a Satisfactory Tools Calculator](https://u4.satisfactorytools.com/production?share=HkKVDnJCG7rEVjV5QmOl)

_Keep in mind that the this calculator doesn't do the complicated oil setups and power is not accounting for everything. I had to make assumptions for miners in my models._

You'll be somewhere in the vicinity of:
- Moving about 850,000 items  
- Building about 24,000 machines  
- Needing over 450,000 MW of power  

You'll drain the map's maximum resources by the following:
- Limestone: 45%  
- Iron Ore: 91%  
- Copper Ore: 80%  
- Caterium Ore: 88%  
- Coal: 81%  
- Raw Quartz: 100%  
- Sulfur: 41%  
- Bauxite: 100%  
- Crude Oil: 87%  
- Nitrogen Gas: 51%  

Including Optional Recipes

_Keep in mind that the this calculator doesn't do the complicated oil setups and power is not accounting for everything. I had to make assumptions for miners in my models._

You'll be somewhere in the vicinity of:
- Moving about 600,000 items  
- Building about 15,000 machines  
- Needing over 420,000 MW of power  

You'll drain the map's maximum resources by the following:
- Limestone: 16.5%  
- Iron Ore: 31%  
- Copper Ore: 95%  
- Caterium Ore: 68%  
- Coal: 66%  
- Raw Quartz: 100%  
- Sulfur: 41%  
- Bauxite: 100%  
- Crude Oil: 65.5%  
- Nitrogen Gas: 51%  

#### Powering it

When it comes to power, we have to modify the output. If you power using a mix of Uranium and Plutonium power, you can round down to the following:
- 120 Assembly Director Systems  
- 120 Magnetic Field Generators  
- 30 Thermal Propulsion Rockets  
- 30 Nuclear Pastas  

Complete the last tier in 33.33 minutes or get 101,845,020 points/min in the Awesome Shop.

You can make 9 Plutonium Fuel Rods per minute, and can include the 225GW of Uranium power.

You'll drain the map's maximum resources by the following:
- Limestone: 19%  
- Iron Ore: 30%  
- Copper Ore: 95%  
- Caterium Ore: 72%  
- Coal: 65%  
- Raw Quartz: 98%  
- Sulfur: 61%  
- Bauxite: 100%  
- Crude Oil: 66%  
- Nitrogen Gas: 73%  

#### Required Alternate Recipes
> Pure Iron Ingot  
> Pure Copper Ingot  
> Pure Caterium Ingot  
> Solid Steel Ingot  
> Pure Aluminum Ingot  
> Pure Quartz Crystal  
> Electrode - Aluminum Scrap  
> Sloppy Alumina  
> Alclad Casing  
> Iron Wire  
> Recycled Rubber/Plastic/etc.  
> Encased Industrial Pipe  
> Heavy Encased Frame  
> Heat-Fused Frame  
> Insulated Crystal Oscillator  
> Silicon Circuit Board  
> Crystal Computer  
> Super-State Computer  
> Classic Battery  
> Heat Exchanger  
> Radio Connection Unit  
> Turbo Pressure Motor  

#### Optional Alternate Recipes 
> Rubber Concrete  
> Coated Cable  
> Fused Quickwire  
> Steel Rod  
> Steel Screw  
> Coated Iron Plate  
> Adhered Iron Plate  
> Steamed Copper Sheet  
> Copper Rotor  
> Quickwire Stator  
> Electric Stator  
> Plastic Smart Plating  
> Flexible Framework  

#### Uranium/Plutonium Alternate Recipes
> Nuclear Fuel Unit  
> Fertile Uranium  

That's it. Everything else is not useful to maximize resource use. (If you find something, let me know. I'll update the post if it's true.)

#### My "Sanity and Productivity" Strategy Comparison

[Here it is on a Satisfactory Tools Calculator](https://u4.satisfactorytools.com/production?share=oPcFLzRCqGneYGvRiqYR)

In my [alternate recipe ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/mnwugx/update_4_alternate_recipe_indepth_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for making the game easier, we are able to get the following:
- 80 Assembly Director Systems  
- 80 Magnetic Field Generators  
- 20 Thermal Propulsion Rockets  
- 20 Nuclear Pastas  

Complete the last tier in 50.00 minutes or get 67,896,680 points/min in the Awesome Shop.
- Moving about 400,000 items  
- Building about 8,700 machines  
- Needing over 220,000 MW of power  

You'll drain the map's maximum resources by the following:
- Limestone: 29%  
- Iron Ore: 46%  
- Copper Ore: 90%  
- Caterium Ore: 78%  
- Coal: 55%  
- Raw Quartz: 88%  
- Sulfur: 44%  
- Bauxite: 96%  
- Crude Oil: 68%  
- Nitrogen Gas: 30%  

Leaving plenty of resources for the power using just Oil and Uranium alone. You can sink the Plutonium Rods!

We cut the following items from the production chain:
- Polymer Resin  
- Compacted Coal  
- Cable  
- Iron Rod  
- Screw  
- Alclad Aluminum Sheet  
- Plastic  
- Crystal Oscillator  

#### Compare Strategies at Same Rates

If we compare that to the previous strategy (using optional recipes, but not powering it to keep it fair) at the same production rates, we see the following for the same number of items/min:
- Moving about 380,000 items  
- Building about 9,600 machines  
- Needing over 270,000 MW of power  

You'll drain the map's maximum resources by the following:
- Limestone: 11%  
- Iron Ore: 20%  
- Copper Ore: 61%  
- Caterium Ore: 44%  
- Coal: 42%  
- Raw Quartz: 64%  
- Sulfur: 26%  
- Bauxite: 64%  
- Crude Oil: 42%  
- Nitrogen Gas: 33%  

We cut the following items from the production chain:

- Polymer Resin  
- Compacted Coal

The production map from the two is extremely different. The Sanity and Productivity strategy is far less complex. It also makes ratios work better, reduces output balancing, does not required crazy oil setups, removes many items from the production chain, and allows you to dump the plutonium rods in the Awesome sink.

The Employee of the Universe strategy makes 50% more products at full capacity, but uses 72% more buildings. The choice is up to how much time you are willing to put into it. It's the same ratios when scaled down, so if you don't plan to max out the game, go for Sanity and Productivity.
